    "abstract": "The differentiation of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in an increasingly competitive landscape requires optimization of clinical efficacy combined with increased patient convenience. We describe here the generation of MEDI5117, a human anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibody generated by variable domain engineering, to achieve subpicomolar affinity for IL-6, combined with Fc (fragment crystallizable) engineering to enhance pharmacokinetic half-life. MEDI5117 was shown to be highly potent in disease-relevant cellular assays. The pharmacokinetics of MEDI5117 were evaluated and compared to those of its progenitor, CAT6001, in a single-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. The antibodies were administered, either subcutaneously or intravenously, as a single dose of 5 mg/kg. The half-life of MEDI5117 was extended by approximately 3-fold, and clearance was reduced by approximately 4-fold when compared to CAT6001. MEDI5117 therefore represents a potential 'next-generation' antibody; future studies are planned to determine the potential for affinity-driven efficacy and/or less frequent administration.",

            "text": "Antibodies represent the fastest-growing class of therapeutics in the pharmaceutical marketplace, with 147 human and 167 humanized monoclonal antibodies having entered clinical development between 1985 and 2008. 1 Analysis of the targets of these antibodies reveals many examples of multiple antibodies to the same target being developed independently. For example, there are currently five approved biologic therapeutics targeting tumor necrosis factor \u03b1: the monoclonal antibody-based products adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol, in addition to a tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 receptor fusion protein, etanercept. In such instances, the ability to differentiate from competitor molecules is likely to be a key factor for long-term commercial success. Increasing the affinity of an antibody for its target by molecular engineering has been shown to increase its potency and activity in both cellular assays and in vivo models, 2 and, in the case of neutralization of a soluble cytokine, a mathematical model has been proposed to predict the effects of affinity gain on in vivo potency. 3 Increasing affinity therefore theoretically represents a means by which a therapeutic antibody can be improved in terms of clinical activity, dose level, or frequency, or a combination of the three. An alternative way to produce an antibody therapeutic that may be more clinically useful is to modify the rate of clearance of the antibody in order to achieve increased serum half-life, which could allow reduced dosing amount and/or frequency. The neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor (FcRn) plays a central role in the homeostasis of serum IgG (reviewed by Ghetie and Ward 4 ). The long halflife of human IgGs is mediated by an FcRndependent mechanism that protects them from intracellular degradation after nonspecific pinocytic uptake and allows their recycling to the cell surface and into the extracellular milieu for continuing circulation. Key to this recycling is the pH-dependent affinity of IgGs for FcRn. Increasing the affinity of IgG for FcRn at selected pH values has been demonstrated to extend its serum half-life in vivo. 5 Specifically, introduction of three mutations, M252Y, S254T, and T256E (hereafter referred to as 'YTE'), into a human IgG1 specific for the F protein of the human respiratory syncytial virus resulted in an approximately 4-fold extension in serum half-life when administered to cynomolgus monkeys. 5 Therefore, there is potential in such an approach to producing a therapeutic with a reduced dosing requirement that may be more convenient for patients. An antibody with an extremely high affinity for its given target antigen, generated via engineering of variable domains, combined with increased serum half-life due to the introduction of YTE mutations, would potentially exhibit desirable qualities such as high potency, efficacy, and reduced dosing level and/or frequency, although any effects on its safety profile would obviously need to be carefully monitored.\nWe have used this hypothesis as the basis for generating an antibody to the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) 6. IL-6 is a 26-kDa pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that belongs to a family of cytokines, including IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, cardiotrophin-like cytokine, and cardiotrophin-1. Each of the members of this family has specific receptor \u03b1 subunits and shares gp130 as a common receptor subunit. IL-6 is produced by a variety of cell types such as lymphocytes (including T and B cells), monocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, osteoblasts, and synovial cells. It is involved in diverse physiological functions: from T-cell activation and stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell proliferation/ differentiation to induction of immunoglobulin secretion, and from initiation of hepatic acute-phase protein synthesis to bone remodeling. 6,7 Perhaps unsurprisingly, given its involvement in multiple physiological processes, elevation of IL-6 due to deregulated production has been implicated in the pathology of various inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Castleman's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Crohn's disease. 8 In addition, circulating IL-6 levels have also been shown to be elevated in several cancers, with the elevation of IL-6 being used as a prognostic indicator. Accordingly, a number of antibodies have been tested as potential therapies in multiple disease indications, generating supportive data for IL-6-modifying therapeutic strategies. An anti-IL-6R\u03b1 antibody [tocilizumab, marketed as Actemra (United States) and Ro-Actemera (outside the United States)] has been approved in Europe, Japan, and the United States for the treatment of RA, and in Japan for the treatment of Castleman's disease; the approval of this molecule has created a strong precedent in the area of IL-6 antagonism. A murine anti-IL-6 antibody, B-E8 (also known as elsilimomab), has been used in clinical trials to treat patients with multiple myeloma, 9 renal cell carcinoma, 10 and RA. 11 A chimeric human-mouse anti-IL-6 antibody, cCLB8 (known as CNTO 328), has been used in clinical trials to treat patients with multiple myeloma. 12 We describe here the generation of a very potent human anti-IL-6 antibody by engineering both variable domains, resulting in a subpicomolar dissociation constant (K d ) for IL-6, coupled with YTE mutations to the CH2 domain of the constant region of the antibody, leading to extended serum half-life in vivo. This whole-molecule modification strategy generated the molecule MEDI5117; further studies are designed to determine whether this may ultimately be confirmed as a best-in-class molecule for IL-6-related disorders.",

Ribosome display was chosen because it facilitates the construction of large libraries of individuals (\u223c 10 12 ) due to its cell-free nature. This large size (compared to phage display, where typically library sizes of above 10 10 are difficult to achieve due to limitations of bacterial transformation efficiency) allows for a greater sampling of the possible diversity (which is too great to ever be completely captured in a library) of a randomly mutated antibody V-gene. Four rounds of selection with decreasing concentrations of biotinylated IL-6 were carried out, the outputs were cloned into pCANTAB6 phagemid vector, and individual scFv-expressing bacterial colonies were screened for improved ability to inhibit IL-6 binding to IL-6R\u03b1 compared to CAN22_D10. Twenty-two scFvs were identified as having an improved ability to inhibit binding of IL-6 to IL-6R\u03b1 (Table 1). Sequence analysis of these antibodies reveals a mixture of randomly distributed mutations and a number of frequently mutated \"hot-spot\" positions (Fig. 2). Particularly striking are hot spots in VH CDR1 at position Ile35, which is commonly mutated to Thr; in VH CDR3 at position Asp98, which is commonly mutated to Gly; and in VL CDR3 at position Thr94, which is commonly mutated to Ala. Four of the most potent of these scFvs were reformatted as IgG1 and tested for potency in the TF-1 neutralization assay, with the most potent variant CNDY033G03 giving an IC 50 of 40 pM, a 2325-fold increase in potency compared to the parent. CNDY033G03 has three changes from the parent in the heavy chain (Asp98Gly, Ile100cAla, and Thr110Ser), as well as three changes in the light chain (Ser9Pro, Thr85Ser, and Thr94Ala) (Fig. 3b).",

            "text": "In order to further increase affinity and potency, we pursued a second mutagenesis strategy targeting the VH and VL CDR3 regions of CAN22_D10 (Fig. 1). Separate scFv libraries of CAN22_D10 were generated with targeted mutagenesis in the VH and VL CDR3 regions. Position W95 at the start of VH CDR3 was not targeted, however, as it was felt that this large amino acid at the base of the CDR3 loop was likely to be important structurally. Improved scFvs were then selected by affinity-based phage display. After the completion of three rounds of selection, the VH and VL randomized libraries were recombined to form a single library in which clones contained randomly paired and individually randomized VH and VL sequences. Selections were then continued as previously described in the presence of decreasing concentrations of biotinylated IL-6 (0.1 nM-0.1 pM over a further four rounds). An epitope competition assay based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer was developed with that antibody, based on homogeneous binding of labeled CNDY33G03 IgG to labeled IL-6, in order to identify clones of higher affinity than CNDY33G03. A total of 4928 scFvs were screened as crude bacterial periplasmic extracts, resulting in the identification of 176 scFvs that inhibited CNDY33G03 binding by N 50% (data not shown). The 12 most potent unique variants in this screen were tested in the TF-1 proliferation assay as purified scFvs; among these, the 3 most potent unique variants were converted into full-length IgG1 and retested in this assay (Table 2). Sequence analysis of the improved variants highlighted several key features (Table 2 and Fig. 4). The most striking feature of CDR3 changes is that 10 of the 12 improved variants have a deletion at Kabat position 95 (Phe) in VL CDR3. This deletion was not encoded for as part of the mutagenic oligonucleotide design and, as such, is a serendipitous change, presumably due to mispriming during mutagenesis. Interestingly, the two improved variants that did not have a deletion at VL Phe95 (CNDY118G05 and CNDY118G06) both contained an insertion mutation of an Ile in VH CDR3 at position 100d. Taken together, these finding suggest a certain amount of tolerated plasticity in the lengths of both the VH and the VL CDR3 loops associated with improved binding to IL-6, indicating that introducing variation in these loop lengths may be an additional important strategy for in vitro antibody affinity engineering.\nWe analyzed amino acid usage within the VH and VL CDR3 loops for improved variants derived from either the random approach or the targeted approach, as well as loop length (Fig. 4). For VH CDR3, the most invariant position was Asp101, which was never changed, followed by Ala96, which was changed in only two of the improved variants. Position Asp98 was mutated to a Gly in 14 out of 22 improved variants from the random mutagenesis strategy, but in only one out of those derived from the CDR targeting approach, CNDY119E08, which interestingly was the least potent variant in this panel (Table 2). There is also a clear difference between the two strategies at VH positions Tyr100 and Tyr100a. From the random mutagenesis strategy, these positions were not selected for mutagenesis, whereas in the targeted variants, these positions were changed in all but one case. A striking feature here is that in 9 of the 12 variants, at least one of these tyrosine residues has been replaced with a proline (and in 4 of the 12 variants, two of these tyrosine residues have been replaced with two prolines. This is likely to have a very significant structural impact, given the conformational rigidity of proline, due to its \u03c6 backbone dihedral angle of approximately -75\u00b0. Compared to VH CDR3, there is less sequence variation in VL CDR3 partly because, in the improved variants from random mutagenesis, only one position shows a strong propensity for change (Thr94, which is mutated to Ala in 9 out of 22 variants) and partly because, from the panel of improved variants from targeted approach, all but two (CNDY118G05 and CNDY118G06) have very similar mutations (Table 2). The Thr94 hot-spot position is mutated in every improved variant derived from targeted mutagenesis, although glycine, rather than alanine, is preferred in all but two of the variants. Other significant changes in VL CDR3 include replacement of Tyr90 with a Trp in all but two of the targeted leads, replacement of Trp96 with a Gly in the same variants, and replacement of Ser93 with Leu.",

            "text": "The most potent antibody identified from affinity maturation, CNDY121C05, was renamed CAT6001. In order to potentially support in vivo studies with this antibody, we calculated the apparent affinity for both human and cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) IL-6 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Table 2). The apparent affinities for both human and cynomolgus IL-6 reached the limit of sensitivity of the instrument (BIAcore T100), which, according to the manufacturers, is approximately a K d of less than 10 pM, with off-rates too slow to be measured in a practical time frame (Supplementary Data). As an alternate measure of K d , a pA 2 -like analysis of potency in the TF-1 assay was carried out (Table 2 and Fig. 5). Concentration-response curves of IL-6 were generated in the presence of fixed concentrations of CAT6001 (Fig. 5a). Increasing concentrations of IL-6 caused an increase in the proliferation of the cells, and different concentrations of CAT6001 caused a rightwards shift in this response. Taking this approach, we obtained an approximate apparent K d of 0.40 pM (Fig. 5b; 95% confidence interval: 0.12-0.69 pM; n = 6). Using this approach, we assumed that a given pharmacologically measured response is dependent on the concentrations of the ligand and the inhibitor at the receptor, and also on the affinity of the inhibitor, classically for the receptor that mediates the response. This measure, while used routinely for competitive receptor antagonists, is not commonly used for antibodies to ligands. However, the original equation was based on Michaelis-Menten principles and, using this equation to create our own mathematic model and to model real data, we observed that this measure did in fact approximate well for the K d of the antibody to the ligand (unpublished results). Moreover, this value was consistent with the very high potencies observed in TF-1 assays   when measuring potency empirically by IC 50 in this assay.\nC H R P K M T Y W F V L I N Q E D S A G D I V M T Q S P S T L S A S V G D R V T I T C R A S Q G I S S W L A W Y Q Q K P G R A P K V L I Y K A S T L E S G V P S R F S G S G S G T D F T L T I S S L Q P E D F A T Y Y C Q Q S Y S T P W T F G Q G T K L E I K C H R P K M T Y W F V L I N Q E D S A G E V Q L V Q S G G G L I Q P G G S L R L S C A A S G F T I S S N Y M I W V R Q A P G K G L E WV S D L Y Y Y A G D T Y Y A D S V K G R F T M S R D I S K N T V Y L Q M N S L R A E D T G V Y Y C A R W A D D H Y Y Y I D V WG R G T L V T V S S CDR1 CDR2 CDR3",

IL-6 then binds with the exogenous soluble human IL-6R\u03b1 to form the IL-6/ IL-6R\u03b1 complex in the culture. This complex then interacts with gp130 on the cell membrane of RA-FLS to trigger VEGF production (Fig. 6b).

Screening the mutant scFvs for competition with the parental antibody CAN22_D10 for binding to IL-6 in a homogeneous assay based on fluorescent resonance energy transfer resulted in the identification of many improved variants, of which the most potent was CNDY33G03. One of the limitations of such a screen is the dynamic range by which improved variants can be differentiated from one another when assayed at a single dilution of an unpurified bacterial extract. By replacing the CAN22_D10 parent with the improved CNDY33G03 variant in the competition screen, we widened the dynamic range of the assay, as CNDY33G03 was more difficult to compete with, allowing the differentiation of further improved mutants. This 'second- Response is the percent maximal proliferation to IL-6 in the TF-1 proliferation assay (data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of n = 3 independent experiments). (b) Schild plot analysis (derived from the data in (a)) to generate the apparent K d of the antibody. Dose ratios were generated using 50% response levels of IL-6 in the presence and in the absence of antibody and log(dose ratio -1) plotted against log[antibody](M). The x-intercept of the fitted regression line is an estimate of pA 2 , which is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist. generation' competition screen of the CDR3-loopmutated scFvs resulted in the identification of variants with N 10-fold greater potency than CNDY33G03, of which CNDY121C05 was the most potent. Comparing the potencies (Fig. 3a) and associated selected mutations (Fig. 3b andc) of CNDY121C05 with those of CNDY033G03, we found it clear that there are at least two clear evolutionary paths that CAN22_D10 can take during affinity maturation. The random mutagenesis approach, which more closely mimics the natural somatic hypermutation associated with the in vivo immune response, led to the selection of an antibody with distinct mutations in both framework and CDR positions and with an IC 50 of 40 pM in the TF-1 cellular proliferation assay. The second approach, whereby the CDR3 loops were targeted for focused mutagenesis, coupled with a screening strategy that was specifically designed to identify antibodies with higher affinity and potency than CNDY033G03, led to the isolation of an antibody with an IC 50 of 1.6 pM in the TF-1 proliferation assay, representing a further 25-fold improvement. The factors leading to this improvement over CNDY033G03 are likely to be a combination of the following: (a) the random mutagenesis library not being sufficiently large to cover all possible variations in all positions, even in a cell-free ribosome-display format; (b) the targeting and recombination of the CDR3 loops being a more efficient mutagenesis strategy than a random strategy; and (c) the screen for the targeted approach being more sensitive, allowing for the identification of more potent/higher-affinity anti-IL-6 antibodies.\nIn order to determine the affinity of CNDY121C05 (renamed CAT6001) for IL-6, we initially undertook SPR. Calculated dissociation constants from our initial analysis indicated that the k off of this antibody was at the limits of the BIAcore system (10 -5 s -1 ; Supplemental Data ). 19 We therefore undertook a pA 2 -type analysis of data from the cellular proliferation assay by varying the concentrations of CAT6001 and by measuring the EC 50 potencies of IL-6. Schild analysis was then used to calculate a K d of 0.4 pM. This is one of the highest affinities reported. 3,20,21 This affinity translated into high potency in a cellular assay using FLS derived from RA patients, whereby IL-1\u03b2 addition led to the induction of IL-6 expression and subsequent VEGF production. The ability of CAT6001 to inhibit in this assay provides evidence that the antibody is a potent inhibitor of endogenously produced IL-6 in a clinically relevant tissue. Thus, any potential posttranslational modifications that may lead to differences between endogenously expressed IL-6 and the recombinantly generated IL-6 used in antibody generation do not appear to affect the potency of CAT6001.\nThe Fc region of CAT6001 IgG1 was mutated to incorporate the triple mutation YTE into the Fc CH2 domain, which has previously been shown to increase antibody serum persistence. The resultant molecule MEDI5117 was compared with CAT6001 in terms of potency in both TF-1 and FLS assays, and in terms of binding affinity for human and cynomolgus FcRn in a pharmacokinetic study in cynomolgus monkeys. As previously reported, 5 the addition of the YTE mutations did not affect binding to antigen but increased the affinity for both human and cynomolgus FcRn in a pH-dependent manner. Immunoglobulins, like the majority of the proteins with a molecular mass greater than 50 kDa, are eliminated from the circulation by the lysosomal catabolism that follows internalization by pinocytosis in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, which express FcRn on their membrane. IgGs have a low affinity for FcRn at a physiologic pH of 7.4, but a higher affinity at pH 6.0. In lysosomal vesicles at acidic pH, IgGs will bind to FcRn, which protects IgGs from proteolytic degradation. Once the vesicles are recycled back to the cell membrane, IgGs will be released by FcRn at pH 7.4 into the circulation. A selective increase in affinity at pH 6.0 was expected to translate into an increase in antibody exposure in vivo as a result of a more efficient recycling. MEDI5117 demonstrated extended serum half-life in vivo, with an approximately 3-fold reduction in clearance compared to CAT6001. Previous examples of pharmacokinetically altered antibodies-either utilizing YTE mutations, 5,22 using alternative Fc mutations that improve FcRn binding, 16,17,23 engineering pH dependency into antigen binding, 24 or decreasing the isoelectric point of the antibody 25 -have shown similar delays in serum clearance in primates. There has been no report of a pharmacokinetic study in humans using any of these approaches; thus, whether the altered pharmacokinetics described in primates will translate into similar results in patients, which will be the ultimate proof of concept for such strategies, remains to be seen.\nClinical development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to monomeric cytokines is under way for a variety of targets such as IL-6, 9-12 IL-13, 26 and IL-9, 27 and therefore represents a potentially important strategy for tackling a range of serious diseases. A monoclonal antibody to the monomeric chemokine CCL2 (chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2)/MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1) has been observed to increase the level of total CCL2/MCP-1 in patient serum in a clinical trial, 28 potentially due to inefficient clearance of the antibody-antigen complex. Care must therefore be taken in the design of preclinical and clinical studies of monoclonal antibodies to such targets.\nThe holistic approach taken here to engineer the entire IgG molecule has generated an antibody that warrants further study to determine its potential as a 'next-generation' treatment for a variety of IL-6mediated inflammatory diseases.",

A representative proportion of the produced variant population was used as template for a second round of errorprone PCR, under the same conditions, for further diversification. The resulting population of randomly mutated CAN22_D10 scFvs was then converted into ribosome-display format and used in affinity-based ribosome-display selections essentially as described previously. 31 At the DNA level, a T7 promoter was added at the 5\u2032-end for efficient transcription to mRNA.

An antigen-capture electrochemiluminescence assay was utilized to determine MEDI5117 and CAT6001 concentrations in cynomolgus monkey plasma. Briefly, MA2400 96-well plates (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD) were coated with 2.5 \u03bcg/ml recombinant human IL-6 (R&D Systems) overnight at 2-8 \u00b0C, washed with PBS and 0.05% Tween 20, and blocked with I-Block Buffer (Tropix) for 1-2 h at room temperature. CAT6001 or MEDI5117 reference standard, quality control, and test sample dilutions were prepared in 1% cynomolgus monkey plasma (assay matrix) and added to blocked plates for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and incubated for 1 h with 1 \u03bcg/ml MSD-TAG (ruthenium)-labeled sheep anti-human IgG (H + L) monkey adsorbed detection antibody (The Binding Site, San Diego, CA). Plates were washed, 1\u00d7 Read Buffer T (Meso Scale Discovery) was added, and plates were read with a Sector Imager 2400 (MSD). CAT6001 or MEDI5117 antibody concentrations in quality control and test sample dilutions on each plate were quantitated using the reference standard curve for that plate. All analyses were performed by plotting standard curve concentrations versus electrochemiluminescence signal in a log-log curve fit in SoftMax Pro GxP software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assay range for both CAT6001 and MEDI5117 quantitation was 10,000-13.7 ng/ml (10-0.0137 \u03bcg/ml) in 100% plasma.\nNoncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed on the mean CAT6001 and MEDI5117 pharmacokinetic data using WinNonlin Professional (version 5.2; Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA). Clearance was calculated as dose/AUC inf after the first dose. The area under the serum concentration-time curves (AUC inf ) after the first dose was estimated by the linear/log trapezoidal by extrapolating the concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity.\nThe elimination rate constant (\u03bb z ) was determined by least-squares regression of the log-transformed concentration data using the terminal phase, identified by inspection, between day 1 and day 57. The elimination half-life was calculated as t 1/2 \u03bb z = ln2/\u03bb z .",

The closest homologue for CNDY121C05 VH is 2FJH, with 76% sequence identity, and that for CNDY121C05 VL is 3HMW, with 86% sequence identity. A single-chain global template was identified using the local Discovery Studio 2.5.5. database (PDB_Antibody) for both single chains. The closest global homologue for CNDY033G03 is 1FVC, with 52% sequence identity, and that for CNDY121C05 is 2ZJS, with 28% sequence identity. Sequence alignments were optimized, and three-dimensional homology models were built using MODELLER. 36 It performed automated protein homology modeling and loop modeling. For both single chains, the best homology models for VH and VL were superimposed on the global template. VH and VL models were combined in a single structure file retaining the orientation. The homology models of single chains were submitted to side-chain optimization and minimization steps, followed by model validation.",

(b) Schild plot analysis (derived from the data in (a)) to generate the apparent K d of the antibody. Dose ratios were generated using 50% response levels of IL-6 in the presence and in the absence of antibody and log(dose ratio -1) plotted against log[antibody](M). The x-intercept of the fitted regression line is an estimate of pA 2 , which is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist.",

(b) In the presence of sIL-1R\u03b1 (2.4 nM), the IL-6/sIL-6R\u03b1 complex results in increased VEGF release. (c) Inhibition of IL-6-mediated VEGF release from IL-1\u03b2stimulated RA-FLS by CAT6001 (0.6 pM IL-1\u03b2 and 2.4 nM sIL-6R\u03b1). Data represent the mean\u00b1 SEM of n = 4 independent experiments. The IC 50 of CAT6001 under these conditions was determined as 672 pM (95% confidence interval: 201-2247 pM).",
