Bands are consistent with VEGF165b (labelled), VEGF189b (a, monomer; and c, dimer) and VEGF121b (b, dimer). The recombinant human (rhVEGF165b) protein is monomerized and unglycosylated and, hence, runs lower than endogenous protein. (Right-hand panel) Western blot of normal placentae probed with antibody to all isoforms. Multiple bands are expressed at high levels, in particular at much higher levels than in prostate tissue, indicating much higher VEGFxxx expression than VEGFxxxb expression in placenta.",
