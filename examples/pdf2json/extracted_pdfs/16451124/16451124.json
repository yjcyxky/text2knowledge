    "abstract": "PET (pre-eclamptic toxaemia) has recently been linked with alterations in production of a VEGFR1 [VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptor 1] splice variant that acts as a circulating inhibitor. We have recently described a family of naturally occurring splice variants of VEGF, termed VEGF xxx b, that also appear to act as inhibitors of conventional VEGF xxx -mediated angiogenesis. To determine whether alteration in splicing of VEGF-VEGFR family members extended beyond VEGFR1, we investigated the effect of pre-eclampsia on placental VEGF xxx b mRNA and protein expression. VEGF xxx and VEGF xxx b mRNA and protein were both found in normal human term placentae. VEGF xxx protein formed the majority of the total VEGF protein (980 + \u2212 195 pg/mg), whereas VEGF xxx b (11.5 pg/mg) was found to form a small part of the total VEGF protein expression (1.5 + \u2212 0.24 %). Evidence for VEGF b, VEGF b and VEGF b expression was found. In pre-eclamptic placentae, there was a significant down-regulation of VEGF xxx b isoforms, but a small up-regulation of VEGF xxx isoforms. In normal placenta VEGF xxx b and VEGF xxx concentrations were positively correlated (r = 0.69, P < 0.02), whereas in pre-eclamptic placentae, there was a significant negative correlation between VEGF xxx b and VEGF xxx protein expression (r = \u2212 0.8, P < 0.02), indicating that there was a significant uncoupling of the splicing regulation of the VEGF isoforms. Combined with previous studies showing increased soluble VEGFR1 isoforms in human pre-eclampsia, these data suggest that there may be a common mechanism in pre-eclampsia that involves dysregulation of mRNA splicing of members of the VEGF-VEGFR axis.",

            "text": "Pre-eclampsia [PET (pre-eclamptic toxaemia)] occurs in 3-5 % of first pregnancies and is characterized by widespread endothelial dysfunction [1]. Failure of adequate trophoblast invasion and placental development results in an underperfused placenta, which is proposed to re-lease unidentified products into the maternal circulation that underlie this endothelial cell dysfunction [1], resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including hypertension, proteinuria, cerebral oedema and infarction, eclampsia (seizures), pulmonary oedema, liver haemorrhage, renal failure and coagulopathy. The foetus may also be severely affected by the disease either by growth restriction due to placental insufficiency or by premature delivery [2]. The clinical picture is resolved with removal of the placenta. The condition may occur from 20 weeks of gestation and is a worldwide problem both in the developing and developed world. For instance, it remains a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the U.K. [3]. Despite the great improvements in obstetric practice that have been established over the last 40 years, pre-eclampsia remains a leading cause of both maternal and infant mortality and morbidity worldwide.\nThe putative circulating factors that may link placental underdevelopment to systemic endothelial dysfunction in PET have not yet been identified, but many candidates have been proposed. We have shown recently [4], using a novel amphibian model to identify permeabilizing agents in human plasma, that a large-molecular-mass molecule circulating in human plasma from severe pre-eclamptic patients, but not normal or mildly pre-eclamptic patients, increases vascular permeability. Candidates include the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) family of growth factors and receptors, which include potent proangiogenic molecules that regulate systemic endothelial cell function, vascular permeability, angiogenesis and blood flow.\nVEGF was first termed vascular permeability factor when it was partially isolated in ascitic fluid in 1983 due its ability to increase vascular permeability [5]. Subsequently a number of members of this family of angiogenic cytokines have been discovered, including VEGF-B, -C, -D and -E as well as PlGF (placental growth factor). The predominant conventional form, VEGF-A (or simply VEGF), is expressed as six main isoforms caused by alternative exon splicing, resulting in mature proteins varying from 121-206 amino acids (in most tissues the dominant isoform is VEGF , but in placenta VEGF and VEGF 121 are also found). VEGF is the dominant angiogenic molecule in physiological and pathological angiogenesis [6]. It is produced by a variety of cells and tissues, including the placental syncytiotrophoblasts and placental endothelial cells [7,8], and its production is greatly increased by hypoxia [9,10]. The placental bed in pre-eclamptic pregnancies has also been shown to have higher levels of HIF-1\u03b1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1), which is a potent promoter of VEGF production [11]. Clinical studies have also demonstrated that VEGF expression is up-regulated in pre-eclamptic placentae that are underperfused, as demonstrated by umbilical artery Doppler abnormalities [12].\nHowever, although the properties of VEGF rapidly led to its investigation as a potential pathophysiological molecule in PET, there has been considerable controversy over the levels of circulating levels of VEGF in PET over the last 10 years [13,14]. High VEGF levels have been identified in circulating plasma [15], amniotic fluid [16], umbilical cord serum [17] and urine [18] in PET. Moreover mRNA levels have been shown to be increased in pre-eclamptic placenta for VEGF and VEGFR (VEGF receptor) 1 [8,19]. However, VEGF ELISAs are susceptible to interference by VEGF-binding molecules such as sFlt-1 and heparin. A polyclonal VEGF RIA confirmed that total circulating VEGF concentrations increase from 20 weeks of gestation in women who will ultimately develop PET compared with normotensive controls [20,21]. Post-delivery VEGF concentrations fall in both PET and control women, suggesting that the placenta is a significant source of VEGF production in pregnancy [21]. VEGF protein and mRNA studies have been inconclusive and contradictory [8,22], and this may relate to differences in expression in different degrees of clinical severity: presence of hypertension alone, the classic triad (hypertension, poor placental development and proteinuria) and/or the addition of FGR (foetal growth restriction) or haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) [7].\nIn contrast, a large number of studies have shown that free, available, VEGF levels are significantly reduced in pre-eclampsia [23,24]. This contradictory evidence is likely to be due to circulating forms of VEGFR1 (sFlt-1) which bind to VEGF [25]. Therefore, although the total levels of VEGF may be increased in pre-eclampsia, the physiologically active concentration (the unbound free levels of VEGF) may actually be reduced. sVEGFR1 (soluble VEGFR1) is a secreted splice variant of VEGFR1 that lacks the cytoplasmic tail. High circulating levels of sVEGFR1 in PET have been identified by a number of laboratories [19,26,27], with high levels occurring weeks prior to any clinical manifestations. High levels of plasma sVEGFR1 are mirrored by reduced membranebound VEGFR1 in placental beds [19] and are accompanied by high levels of circulating VEGF and low levels of PlGF [19]. High levels of sVEGFR1 antagonize the effects of VEGF and PlGF on placental development, vascularization and maternal endothelial cell function [19]. Recent studies, however, measuring molar concentrations of VEGF and sVEGFR1 in the same samples have shown that VEGF levels in circulating plasma are at least 15-fold higher than sVEGFR1 [15]. Therefore current clinical evidence suggests pre-eclampsia is characterized by high concentrations of circulating total VEGF and low concentrations of free VEGF. Surprisingly, however, the protein levels of VEGF in the placentae of patients with pre-eclampsia have not been published previously.\nHypertension in PET is thought to be due to impairment of normal endothelium-dependent relaxation mechanisms that regulate vasodilatation. Functional evidence for the potential importance of VEGF in PET comes from experiments using myometrial resistance vessels obtained at Caesarean section and investigation of the endothelial behaviour of the vessels using a wire myograph technique [28]. Plasma from women with PET, but not normotensive pregnancies, resulted in a reduction of the normal endothelium-dependent relaxation. This response did not occur when the plasma was incubated with anti-VEGF antibodies before exposure to the resistance vessels [28]. Thus VEGF may be important in mediating the endothelial response that occurs in PET, although how overexpression of a vasodilator such as VEGF results in hypertension is not immediately obvious.\nIn 2002, we described a novel group of VEGF splice variants that inhibit conventional VEGF [29]. These isoforms code for splice variants of the same size as VEGF-A isoforms described previously, but have an alternatively spliced C-terminus. These isoforms have been termed VEGF XXX b, hence VEGF 121 b, VEGF 165 b etc. These isoforms would be identified erroneously as their sister conventional pro-angiogenic isoforms by all previous ELISA, Western blot and immunohistology assays, and most RT (reverse transcription)-PCR studies conducted on preeclamptic samples. VEGF 165 b inhibits VEGF 165 -mediated HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cell) proliferation and migration [29], VEGF 165 -mediated vasodilation ex vivo [29] and angiogenesis in vivo [30]. It appears to binds to VEGFR2, but does not activate it (i.e. the functional effects of the VEGF xxx and VEGF xxx b families are different when bound to at least one VEGFR) [29].\nIt is possible, therefore, that the changes described previously in VEGF expression in pre-eclampsia may be ascribed to changes in the pro-angiogenic or anti-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF. In the present study, we have therefore measured the concentrations of both isoforms in placentae from human pre-eclamptic patients and compared them with control subjects.",

When similar blots were probed with an antibody that detects all VEGF isoforms (including VEGF xxx b), many of the same bands were also apparent, showing that normal placental samples had significant expression of both pro-and antiangiogenic isoforms, but at much higher intensity (Figure 2, right-hand panel). Due to the differential nature of the antibodies, it was impossible to determine quantitatively the relative expression of these isoforms in normal or pre-eclamptic placentae.

            "text": "The fundamental aetiology of pre-eclampsia is still unknown. The pathophysiological symptoms of hypertension, proteinuria and increased vascular permeability have been interpreted as being consistent with alterations in expression, activity or binding of the VEGF family of proteins. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a propermeability pro-angiogenic vasodilator that is expressed during conditions of hypoxia, ischaemia or under-perfusion. Therefore some of the pathological sequelae of pre-eclampsia might be explained by an increase in VEGF expression resulting from placental underperfusion. Total circulating VEGF has been shown to be up-regulated in pre-eclamptic plasma and serum from approx. 5-10 ng/ml to 10-90 ng/ml depending on the study [14,21,31-33] using competitive enzyme immunoassays or RIAs. In contrast, free circulating VEGF levels have been shown in many studies to be reduced in pre-eclampsia, from 5-100 pg/ml in normal pregnancy to unmeasurable in preeclampsia [23][24][25]34,35]. sVEGFR1 reduces the measured   There was a significant positive correlation between the two families of isoforms in normal placentae (P < 0.05, as determined by Spearman correlation), which was reversed in pre-eclampsia, indicating alteration in splicing.\nVEGF levels by ELISA, but one recent study showed that the circulating VEGF was in 30-fold molar excess compared with sVEGFR1 [15] in serum from women with pre-eclampsia before delivery, suggesting that the circulating free VEGF must be reduced by a combination of circulating factors, including sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2 (which is reduced in pre-eclampsia) [36].\nInjection of adenovirus expressing sVEGFR1, resulting in a 3-fold molar excess of sVEGFR1 compared with VEGF, has been shown to produce signs reminiscent of pre-eclampsia in animal models [25], and sVEGFR1 in ex vivo models can inhibit endothelial cell migration and tube formation [37]. In addition, renal glomerular specific knockout of VEGF has been shown to result in proteinuria and renal dysfunction similar to that in preeclampsia [38]. It is therefore clear that, although current clinical evidence suggests pre-eclampsia is characterized by high concentrations of total VEGF and low concentrations of free VEGF, this literature needs to be re-assessed after taking into account the presence of VEGF xxx b.\nWe recently described the novel VEGF xxx b family of VEGF isoforms that can inhibit angiogenesis and vasodilatation induced by VEGF [29,30]. The results from the present study suggest that this family of isoforms is poorly expressed in the normal placenta, but even more down-regulated in pre-eclampsia. Placental-derived VEGF xxx b may therefore be considered to be unlikely to contribute to the pre-eclamptic pathology at term, since it is unlikely to inhibit the large amount of pro-angiogenic VEGF xxx being produced by the placenta under both normal and pre-eclamptic conditions. The precise location of the placental expression of VEGF xxx b seen in Figure 3, however, means that we cannot rule out that a small down-regulation of VEGF xxx b protein in the entire placenta does not reflect a very significant change in the microdomain concentration, i.e. immediately around the endothelial cells. Placentally derived VEGF xxx b is, however, unlikely to contribute significantly to the altered circulating levels of pre-eclampsia seen just at term, although VEGF xxx b derived from other sources may still contribute. It should be noted that pre-eclamptic samples were from a slightly reduced gestation than controls (37 compared with 38 weeks), and further work is required to determine the expression levels of the VEGF xxx b during gestation.\nAs VEGF 165 b appears to inhibit angiogenesis induced by VEGF 165 in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner, VEGF b is unlikely to prevent angiogenesis in the placenta, and the functional significance of VEGF b expression in placenta is unknown. One caveat though is that we currently do not know the proportion of circulating VEGF that is VEGF xxx b, nor do we know how VEGF b interacts with sVEGFR1. Interestingly, in other human tissue fluids, such as the vitreous, VEGF 165 b levels are as high as 66 % of the total VEGF. The VEGF xxx b ELISA described in the present study is unsuitable for plasma samples as it results in a high background in plasma and serum, but determination of the circulating levels of VEGF 165 b in normal pregnancy and pre-eclampsia will be of value in the future.\nPerhaps the most surprising finding, however, was that the VEGF xxx b levels in pre-eclampsia lost their positive relationship with VEGF xxx isoforms. We have shown previously that VEGF xxx b mRNA was down-regulated in prostate and renal carcinoma [29,30]. Similarly, VEGF xxx b protein was not up-regulated in diabetic vitreous, whereas VEGF xxx protein was up-regulated [39]. The results described in the present study show that pathophysiological processes other than cancer can specifically down-regulate the anti-angiogenic family of protein isoforms, while at the same time up-regulating the pro-angiogenic isoforms. Three mechanisms for this alternate regulation include differential promoter selection [40], alternate regulation of mRNA stability, and hence translation [41], and regulation of alternate splicing [42]. All three of these mechanisms may contribute to this alternate expression of protein isoforms, but the promoter regions regulating VEGF xxx b expression, the differential mRNA stability of the two isoforms or the splicing factors involved in alternate regulation of VEGF have not been identified [43].\nPerhaps, more importantly, VEGF xxx b is not the only VEGF related splicing event that occurs in pre-eclampsia. sVEGFR1, also up-regulated in pre-eclampsia [44], is a splice variant of VEGFR1, formed by intron inclusion (failure of intron excision) [45], which results in a circulating extracellular domain of VEGFR1 that can bind to and inactivate VEGF isoforms, although its effect on VEGF xxx b isoforms is unknown. As discussed above, sVEGFR1 overexpression has recently been shown to be a significant and predicting event in pre-eclampsia generation [26,46], with circulating levels rising during onset of the condition and falling after placental delivery [26]. We therefore suggest that alteration of splicing in pre-eclampsia may not be limited just to sVEGFR1, and in fact one previous study [19] has shown that, although sVEGFR1 mRNA levels are increased in pre-eclamptic placentae, membrane-bound VEGFR1 levels are decreased in the placental bed of patients with pre-eclampsia. Altered splicing may occur in a wider variety of genes that regulate angiogenesis, including VEGF. These alterations in splicing may either be a result of or a cause of poor angiogenesis, hypertension and increased permeability. It is therefore possible that a common mechanism may underlie these two changes. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that other molecules are alternatively spliced in PET, including HLA-G (human leukocyte antigen G) [47], leptin receptors [48] and an aspartyl protease [49]. Since the investigation of spliceomics has yet to come of age and is currently overshadowed by transcriptomics and proteomics, we would be surprised if more splicing shifts in PET do not become apparent in the very near future. We suggest that one of the abnormalities in PET may be one of splicing control.\nIn summary, we have shown that (i) the VEGF xxx b family of anti-angiogenic isoforms of VEGF is a small proportion of the total VEGF pool in term placentae, (ii) they are further down-regulated in pre-eclamptic placentae, (iii) the link between pro-and anti-angiogenic isoform expression is disrupted in pre-eclampsia, indicating that regulation of splicing may be altered in the placenta in these conditions, and (iv) combined with previous studies, implicating alternative splicing of VEGFR1 in pre-eclampsia, these results can be interpreted to support the concept of a generalized splicing dysfunction in pre-eclampsia.",

Revelation Quicklink 4.25 software (Dynex Technologies) was used to construct a standard curve from mean absorbance values of VEGF xxx b standards enabling the estimation of VEGF concentration for each sample based on mean light absorbance across triplicates. All samples were at least greater than the lowest standard concentration. To ensure consistency, samples were repeated at multiple dilutions to ensure that concentrations were within the linear range of the ELISA. This ELISA detects all VEGF xxx b isoforms whether bound to sVEGFR1 or not (Y. Qui, R. M. Perrin, S. Raffy, S. J. Harper and D. O. Bates, unpublished work).",
