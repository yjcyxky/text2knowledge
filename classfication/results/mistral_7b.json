        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The role of mitochondria in post coronavirus disease 2019 (post-COVID-19) complications is unclear, especially in the long-term pulmonary complications. This study aims to investigate the association between post-COVID-19 pulmonary complications and mitochondrial regulatory proteins in the context of oxidative stress. METHODOLOGY: Patients who had recovered from COVID-19 were enrolled. According to the evidence of persistent interstitial lung lesions on computed tomography (CT), patients were divided into a long-term pulmonary complications group (P(+)) and a control group without long-term pulmonary complications (P(-)). We randomly selected 80 patients for investigation (40 subjects for each group). Biomarkers levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The serum concentrations of mitochondrial regulatory proteins were significantly higher in the P(+) group, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1): 1.62 [1.02-2.29] ng/mL vs. 1.34 [0.94-1.74] ng/mL (p = 0.046); Dynamin-1-like protein (DNM1L): 1.6 [0.9-2.4] ng/mL IQR vs. 0.9 [0.5-1.6] ng/mL (p = 0.004); and Mitofusin-2 (MFN2): 0.3 [0.2-0.5] ng/mL vs. 0.2 [0.1-0.3] ng/mL IQR (p = 0.001). Patients from the P(+) group also had higher serum levels of chemokine ligand 18 (PARC, CCL18), IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) cytokines than the P(-) group. The concentration of interferon alpha (IFN-\u03b1) was decreased in the P(+) group. Furthermore, we observed statistically significant correlations between the advanced glycation end product (sRAGE) and TNF-\u03b1 (Pearson's factor R = 0.637; p < 0.001) and between serum levels of DNM1L and IFN-\u03b1 (Pearson's factor R = 0.501; p = 0.002) in P(+) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated concentrations of mitochondrial biomarkers in post-COVID-19 patients with long-term pulmonary complications indicate their possible role in the pathobiology of COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae. Oxidative stress is associated with the immune response and inflammation after COVID-19. TNF-\u03b1 could be a promising biomarker for predicting pulmonary complications and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in patients with post-COVID-19 complications.",

        "abstract": "After five waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks, it has been recognized that a significant portion of the affected individuals developed long-term debilitating symptoms marked by chronic fatigue, cognitive difficulties (\"brain fog\"), post-exertional malaise, and autonomic dysfunction. The onset, progression, and clinical presentation of this condition, generically named post-COVID-19 syndrome, overlap significantly with another enigmatic condition, referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Several pathobiological mechanisms have been proposed for ME/CFS, including redox imbalance, systemic and central nervous system inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Chronic inflammation and glial pathological reactivity are common hallmarks of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders and have been consistently associated with reduced central and peripheral levels of plasmalogens, one of the major phospholipid components of cell membranes with several homeostatic functions. Of great interest, recent evidence revealed a significant reduction of plasmalogen contents, biosynthesis, and metabolism in ME/CFS and acute COVID-19, with a strong association to symptom severity and other relevant clinical outcomes. These bioactive lipids have increasingly attracted attention due to their reduced levels representing a common pathophysiological manifestation between several disorders associated with aging and chronic inflammation. However, alterations in plasmalogen levels or their lipidic metabolism have not yet been examined in individuals suffering from post-COVID-19 symptoms. Here, we proposed a pathobiological model for post-COVID-19 and ME/CFS based on their common inflammation and dysfunctional glial reactivity, and highlighted the emerging implications of plasmalogen deficiency in the underlying mechanisms. Along with the promising outcomes of plasmalogen replacement therapy (PRT) for various neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric disorders, we sought to propose PRT as a simple, effective, and safe strategy for the potential relief of the debilitating symptoms associated with ME/CFS and post-COVID-19 syndrome.",

Studies of autopsy samples from patients who died from COVID-19 detected SARS-CoV-2 in the brain. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation after SARS-CoV-2 infection might play a role in long COVID symptoms.

Most prominently, millions of patients with Long-Covid complain about chronic fatigue and severe post-exertional malaise. Therapeutic apheresis has been suggested as an efficient treatment option for alleviating and mitigating symptoms in this desperate group of patients. However, little is known about the mechanisms and biomarkers correlating with treatment outcomes. Here, we have analyzed in different cohorts of Long-Covid patients specific biomarkers before and after therapeutic apheresis. In patients that reported a significant improvement following two cycles of therapeutic apheresis, there was a significant reduction in neurotransmitter autoantibodies, lipids, and inflammatory markers. Furthermore, we observed a 70% reduction in fibrinogen, and following apheresis, erythrocyte rouleaux formation and fibrin fibers largely disappeared as demonstrated by dark field microscopy. This is the first study demonstrating a pattern of specific biomarkers with clinical symptoms in this patient group. It may therefore form the basis for a more objective monitoring and a clinical score for the treatment of Long-Covid and other postinfectious syndromes.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Long COVID, also known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, refers to the constellation of long-term symptoms experienced by people suffering persistent symptoms for one or more months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blood biomarkers can be altered in long COVID patients; however, biomarkers associated with long COVID symptoms and their roles in disease progression remain undetermined. This study aims to systematically evaluate blood biomarkers that may act as indicators or therapeutic targets for long COVID. METHODS: A systematic literature review in PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL was performed on 18 August 2022. The search keywords long COVID-19 symptoms and biomarkers were used to filter out the eligible studies, which were then carefully evaluated. RESULTS: Identified from 28 studies and representing six biological classifications, 113 biomarkers were significantly associated with long COVID: (1) Cytokine/Chemokine (38, 33.6%); (2) Biochemical markers (24, 21.2%); (3) Vascular markers (20, 17.7%); (4) Neurological markers (6, 5.3%); (5) Acute phase protein (5, 4.4%); and (6) Others (20, 17.7%). Compared with healthy control or recovered patients without long COVID symptoms, 79 biomarkers were increased, 29 were decreased, and 5 required further determination in the long COVID patients. Of these, up-regulated Interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor alpha might serve as the potential diagnostic biomarkers for long COVID. Moreover, long COVID patients with neurological symptoms exhibited higher levels of neurofilament light chain and glial fibrillary acidic protein whereas those with pulmonary symptoms exhibited a higher level of transforming growth factor beta. CONCLUSION: Long COVID patients present elevated inflammatory biomarkers after initial infection. Our study found significant associations between specific biomarkers and long COVID symptoms. Further investigations are warranted to identify a core set of blood biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and manage long COVID patients in clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "Clinical sequelae and symptoms for a considerable number of COVID-19 patients can linger for months beyond the acute stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, \"long COVID\". Among the long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, cognitive issues (especially memory loss or \"brain fog\"), chronic fatigue, myalgia, and muscular weakness resembling myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are of importance. Melatonin may be particularly effective at reducing the signs and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its functions as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immuno-modulatory agent. Melatonin is also a chronobiotic medication effective in treating delirium and restoring the circadian imbalance seen in COVID patients in the intensive care unit. Additionally, as a cytoprotector, melatonin aids in the prevention of several COVID-19 comorbidities, including diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases. This narrative review discusses the application of melatonin as a neuroprotective agent to control cognitive deterioration (\"brain fog\") and pain in the ME/CFS syndrome-like documented in long COVID.

It has been known that an increase in NF could reduce the memory process in the brain but the key factors, associated with NF, behind the dysregulation of memory remained elusive. We previously reported that the NF and aging processes reduced the special phospholipids, plasmalogens (Pls), in the murine brain by a mechanism dependent on the activation of transcription factors, NF-kB and c-MYC. A similar mechanism has also been found in postmortem human brain tissues with AD pathologies and in the AD model mice. Recent evidence showed that these phospholipids enhanced memory and reduced neuro-inflammation in the murine brain. Pls can stimulate the cellular signaling molecules, ERK and Akt, by activating the membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Therefore, recent findings suggest that plasmalogens could be one of the key phospholipids in the brain to enhance memory and inhibit NF.",

METHODS: In all patients, OI analysis by history taking and OI assessed during a tilt test, as well as cerebral blood flow measurements by extracranial Doppler, and cardiac index measurements by suprasternal Doppler during the tilt test were obtained in all patients. RESULTS: Except for disease duration no differences were found in clinical characteristics. The prevalence of POTS was higher in the long-haul patients (100%) than in post-EBV (43%) and in insidious-onset (50%) patients (p = 0.0002). No differences between the three groups were present in the prevalence of OI, heart rate and blood pressure changes, changes in cerebral blood flow or in cardiac index during the tilt test. CONCLUSION: OI symptomatology and objective abnormalities of OI (abnormal cerebral blood flow and cardiac index reduction during tilt testing) are comparable to those in ME/CFS patients.

MIS-C involves systemic hyperinflammation and multiorgan involvement, including severe cardiovascular, gastrointestinal (GI) and neurological symptoms. Some clinical attributes of MIS-C-such as persistent fever, rashes, conjunctivitis and oral mucosa changes (red fissured lips and strawberry tongue)-overlap with features of Kawasaki disease (KD). In addition, MIS-C shares striking clinical similarities with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is triggered by bacterial superantigens (SAgs). The remarkable similarities between MIS-C and TSS prompted a search for SAg-like structures in the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discovery of a unique SAg-like motif highly similar to a Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) fragment in the SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 (S1) glycoprotein. Computational studies suggest that the SAg-like motif has a high affinity for binding T-cell receptors (TCRs) and MHC Class II proteins. Immunosequencing of peripheral blood samples from MIS-C patients revealed a profound expansion of TCR \u03b2 variable gene 11-2 (TRBV11-2), which correlates with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels, consistent with a SAg-triggered immune response. Computational sequence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike further identified conserved neurotoxin-like motifs which may alter neuronal cell function and contribute to neurological symptoms in COVID-19 and MIS-C patients. Additionally, autoantibodies are detected during MIS-C, which may indicate development of post-SARS-CoV-2 autoreactive and autoimmune responses. Finally, prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gut, increased gut permeability and elevated levels of circulating S1 have been observed in children with MIS-C. Accordingly, we hypothesize that continuous and prolonged exposure to the viral SAg-like and neurotoxin-like motifs in SARS-CoV-2 spike may promote autoimmunity leading to the development of post-acute COVID-19 syndromes, including MIS-C and long COVID, as well as the neurological complications resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, there is now an increasing number of patients suffering from the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC Post COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a\u00a0history of probable or confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19 with symptoms and that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis), including neuropsychiatric symptoms. The purpose of this report is to describe the sociodemographic, diagnostic and treatment characteristics of patients evaluated in an outpatient psychiatric setting for PASC. METHODS: A retrospective review of 30 individuals with documented COVID-19 illness treated at a university hospital-based Post-COVID-19 Recovery Program were referred to an outpatient psychiatric department for consultation and treatment from December 2020 to July 2021. All individuals complained of neuropsychiatric symptoms including anxiety, depression, fatigue and cognitive problems. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric diagnosis, prominent psychological themes and treatment prescribed were described and, where applicable, analyzed with SPSS software. RESULTS: The study population consisted of patients between 25 and 82 years old, with a predominance of women between 46 and 60 years. Approximately half of the patient population had a primary diagnosis of major depressive disorder, often combined with prominent anxiety. Over two-thirds of the patient population reported a combination of depression, fatigue and cognitive complaints, predominantly memory and slowed processing speed. Prominent stressors and psychological themes included social and occupational decline, isolation, lack of empathy and understanding from family, friends and employers, and apprehension about future ability to return to their baseline level of function. Treatments recommended included individual and group psychotherapy, medication and cognitive rehabilitation. Modafinil and antidepressants, often in combination, were the most commonly used medications, intended to target the pervasive fatigue, depressive, and anxiety these individuals were facing. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience from this patient population underscored the significant medical, emotional, neurocognitive and functional sequelae of PASC. Management of these individuals requires a collaborative approach with the availability of psychotherapeutic interventions, pharmacologic treatment, neurocognitive assessment and remediation to address these symptoms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Non-respiratory long-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms are mainly related to a long-lasting endothelial dysfunction and microcirculation impairment. We hypothesized that Sulodexide, a purified glycosaminoglycan mixture with a beneficial endothelial effect in arterial and venous peripheral diseases, may be effective in a subset of patients with long COVID-19. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicenter prospective quasi-experimental study. A total of 290 patients from the TUN-EndCOV study with long-COVID-19 symptoms and endothelial dysfunction were included. The endothelial function was clinically assessed using a post-occlusive reactive hyperemia protocol with finger thermal monitoring device. Endothelial quality index (EQI) was assessed at inclusion and at 21 days later. The study population was assigned to a sulodexide group (144 patients) or a no-medical treatment group (146 patients). Clinical characteristics were similar at inclusion in the two groups. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain were the most common symptoms, respectively, 54.5, 53.8, and 28.3%. At 21 days, the sulodexide group improved significantly better than the no-medical treatment group in chest pain (83.7 vs. 43.6%, p < 10-3), palpitations (85.2 vs. 52.9%, p = 0.009), and endothelial function [median delta-EQI 0.66 (0.6) vs. 0.18 (0.3); p < 10-3]. Endothelial function improvement was significantly correlated with chest pain and palpitations recovery (AUC, i.e., area under the curve = 0.66, CI [0.57- 0.75], p = 0.001 and AUC = 0.60, CI [0.51- 0.69], p = 0.03, respectively).

        "abstract": "COVID-19 often causes sequelae after initial recovery, referred to collectively as long COVID. Long COVID is considered to be caused by the persistence of chronic inflammation after acute COVID-19 infection. We found that all long COVID patients had residual inflammation in the epipharynx, an important site of coronavirus replication, and some long COVID symptoms are similar to those associated with chronic epipharyngitis. Epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) is a treatment for chronic epipharyngitis in Japan that involves applying zinc chloride as an anti-inflammatory agent to the epipharyngeal mucosa. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of EAT for the treatment of long COVID. The subjects in this study were 58 patients with long COVID who were treated with EAT in the outpatient department once a week for one month (mean age = 38.4 \u00b1 12.9 years). The intensities of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which are reported as frequent symptoms of long COVID, were assessed before and after EAT using the visual analog scale (VAS). EAT reduced inflammation in the epipharynx and significantly improved the intensity of fatigue, headache, and attention disorder, which may be related to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). These results suggest that EAT has potential as a novel method for long COVID treatment.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Symptoms often persistent for more than 4 weeks after COVID-19-now commonly referred to as 'Long COVID'. Independent of initial disease severity or pathological pulmonary functions tests, fatigue, exertional intolerance and dyspnea are among the most common COVID-19 sequelae. We hypothesized that respiratory muscle dysfunction might be prevalent in persistently symptomatic patients after COVID-19 with self-reported exercise intolerance. METHODS: In a small cross-sectional pilot study (n\u2009=\u200967) of mild-to-moderate (nonhospitalized) and moderate-to-critical convalescent (formerly hospitalized) patients presenting to our outpatient clinic approx. 5\u00a0months after acute infection, we measured neuroventilatory activity P0.1, inspiratory muscle strength (PImax) and total respiratory muscle strain (P0.1/PImax) in addition to standard pulmonary functions tests, capillary blood gas analysis, 6\u00a0min walking tests and functional questionnaires. RESULTS: Pathological P0.1/PImax was found in 88% of symptomatic patients. Mean PImax was reduced in hospitalized patients, but reduced PImax was also found in 65% of nonhospitalized patients. Mean P0.1 was pathologically increased in both groups. Increased P0.1 was associated with exercise-induced deoxygenation, impaired exercise tolerance, decreased activity and productivity and worse Post-COVID-19 functional status scale. Pathological changes in P0.1, PImax or P0.1/PImax were not associated with pre-existing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point towards respiratory muscle dysfunction as a novel aspect of COVID-19 sequelae. Thus, we strongly advocate for systematic respiratory muscle testing during the diagnostic workup of persistently symptomatic, convalescent COVID-19 patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence has highlighted a possible association between severe COVID-19 and persistent cognitive deficits. Further research is required to confirm this association, determine whether cognitive deficits relate to clinical features from the acute phase or to mental health status at the point of assessment, and quantify rate of recovery. METHODS: 46 individuals who received critical care for COVID-19 at Addenbrooke's hospital between 10th March 2020 and 31st July 2020 (16 mechanically ventilated) underwent detailed computerised cognitive assessment alongside scales measuring anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder under supervised conditions at a mean follow up of 6.0 (\u00b1 2.1) months following acute illness. Patient and matched control (N\u00a0=\u00a0460) performances were transformed into standard deviation from expected scores, accounting for age and demographic factors using N\u00a0=\u00a066,008 normative datasets. Global accuracy and response time composites were calculated (G_SScore & G_RT). Linear modelling predicted composite score deficits from acute severity, mental-health status at assessment, and time from hospital admission. The pattern of deficits across tasks was qualitatively compared with normal age-related decline, and early-stage dementia. FINDINGS: COVID-19 survivors were less accurate (G_SScore=-0.53SDs) and slower (G_RT=+0.89SDs) in their responses than expected compared to their matched controls. Acute illness, but not chronic mental health, significantly predicted cognitive deviation from expected scores (G_SScore (p=\u200b\u200b0.0037) and G_RT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0366)). The most prominent task associations with COVID-19 were for higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively distinct from the profiles of normal ageing and dementia and similar in magnitude to the effects of ageing between 50 and 70 years of age. A trend towards reduced deficits with time from illness (r\u223c=0.15) did not reach statistical significance. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 relate most strongly to acute illness severity, persist long into the chronic phase, and recover slowly if at all, with a characteristic profile highlighting higher cognitive functions and processing speed.

        "abstract": "Many discharged COVID-19 patients affected by sequelae experience reduced quality of life leading to an increased burden on the healthcare system, their families and society at large. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms of long COVID include: persistent viral replication, chronic hypoxia and inflammation. Ongoing vascular endothelial damage promotes platelet adhesion and coagulation, resulting in the impairment of various organ functions. Meanwhile, thrombosis will further aggravate vasculitis contributing to further deterioration. Thus, long COVID is essentially a thrombotic sequela. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for long COVID. This article summarizes the evidence for coagulation abnormalities in long COVID, with a focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms of thrombosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by various types of cells can carry SARS-CoV-2 through the circulation and attack distant tissues and organs. Furthermore, EVs express tissue factor and phosphatidylserine (PS) which aggravate thrombosis. Given the persistence of the virus, chronic inflammation and endothelial damage are inevitable. Pulmonary structural changes such as hypertension, embolism and fibrosis are common in long COVID. The resulting impaired lung function and chronic hypoxia again aggravates vascular inflammation and coagulation abnormalities. In this article, we also summarize recent research on antithrombotic therapy in COVID-19. There is increasing evidence that early anticoagulation can be effective in improving outcomes. In fact, persistent systemic vascular inflammation and dysfunction caused by thrombosis are key factors driving various complications of long COVID. Early prophylactic anticoagulation can prevent the release of or remove procoagulant substances, thereby protecting the vascular endothelium from damage, reducing thrombotic sequelae, and improving quality of life for long-COVID patients.",

The strength of safety, well-acceptance, and accumulating scientific evidence has now afforded nutritional medicine a place in the mainstream of neuropsychiatric intervention and prophylaxis. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 or n-3 PUFAs) might have favorable effects on immunity, inflammation, oxidative stress and psychoneuroimmunity at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Omega-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA, have shown effects in treating mood and neurocognitive disorders by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, altering the HPA axis, and modulating neurotransmission via lipid rafts. In addition, omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites, including specialized pro-resolvin mediators, accelerate the process of cleansing chronic inflammation and restoring tissue homeostasis, and therefore offer a promising strategy for Long COVID. In this article, we explore in a systematic review the putative molecular mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites counteract the negative effects of long COVID on the brain, behavior, and immunity.",

METHODS: A cohort study including patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in one urban hospital of Madrid (Spain) during the first wave of the outbreak (from March 20 to June 30, 2020) was conducted. Hospitalization data, clinical data, and eleven serological biomarkers were systematically collected at hospital admission. Patients were scheduled for an individual telephone interview after hospital discharge for collecting data about the presence of post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea. RESULTS: A total of 412 patients (age: 62 years, standard deviation: 15 years; 47.5% women) were assessed with a mean of 6.8 and 13.2 months after discharge. The prevalence of post-COVID fatigue and dyspnea was 72.8% and 17.2% at 6 months and 45.4% and 13.6% at 12 months after hospital discharge, respectively.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the impact of hypoxia on the cognitive and psychological profile following COVID-19. METHODS: Sixty-two patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a cross-sectional study and divided into two groups based on disease severity: outpatients with no pulmonary complications vs. inpatients with hypoxemic pneumonia having received oxygen therapy. All the participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation that included depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleepiness, attentional, memory and executive processes, and social cognition. For the inpatients, we also collected laboratory data (blood gas, blood glucose, fibrin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein). RESULTS: Cognitive disorders was found in patients with COVID-19: at least 18% had an impairment of memory and 11% had attentional dysfunctions.

METHODS: From the beginning of August 2021 to the end of October 2021, the brain 18F-FDG PET scans of patients referred for suspected neurological long COVID with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and/or serology tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively reviewed in three French nuclear medicine departments (143 patients; 47.4\u00a0years old\u2009\u00b1\u200913.6; 98 women). Experienced nuclear physicians from each department classified brain 18F-FDG PET scans according to the same visual interpretation analysis as being normal, mildly to moderately (or incompletely) affected, or otherwise severely affected within the previously reported long-COVID hypometabolic pattern. RESULTS: On the 143 brain 18F-FDG PET scans performed during this 3-month period, 53% of the scans were visually interpreted as normal, 21% as mildly to moderately or incompletely affected, and 26% as severely affected according to the COVID hypometabolic pattern. On average, PET scans were performed at 10.9\u00a0months from symptom onset (\u00b1\u20094.8). Importantly, this specific hypometabolic pattern was similarly identified in the three nuclear medicine departments. Typical illustrative examples are provided to help nuclear physicians interpret long-COVID profiles. CONCLUSION: The proposed PET metabolic pattern is easily identified upon visual interpretation in clinical routine for approximately one half of patients with suspected neurological long COVID, requiring special consideration for frontobasal paramedian regions, the brainstem and the cerebellum, and certainly further adapted follow-up and medical care, while the second half of patients have normal brain PET metabolism on average 10.9\u00a0months from symptom onset.",

The COVID pandemic has affected dozens of millions of people around the world and has resulted in the deaths of more than 3 million people. Following the acute forms, it has been reported sometimes long forms of COVID, with involvements of several organs including the brain. Neurological complications can include cognitive disturbances (brain fog) that are very common and can seriously disturb the life of patients. METHODS: Fluorodeoxyglucose PETs were performed in 3 patients with cognitive decline following COVID infection. RESULTS: We report here 3 cases of brain fog with major hypometabolic areas of the pons revealed by the cerebral FDG PET. CONCLUSION: The dysfunction of the locus coeruleus in these patients could partly explain the cognitive disorders observed. Further studies involving larger cohorts of patients suffering from cognitive dysfunction will be needed to determine if the brainstem is frequently affected in these patients.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss emerging understandings of adolescent long COVID or post-COVID-19 conditions, including proposed clinical definitions, common symptoms, epidemiology, overlaps with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and orthostatic intolerance, and preliminary guidance on management. RECENT FINDINGS: The recent World Health Organization clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition requires a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms starting within 3\u00a0months of the onset of COVID-19. Symptoms must last for at least 2\u00a0months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms of the post-COVID-19 condition include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms generally have an impact on everyday functioning. The incidence of prolonged symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven challenging to define, but it is now clear that those with relatively mild initial infections, without severe initial respiratory disease or end-organ injury, can still develop chronic impairments, with symptoms that overlap with conditions like ME/CFS (profound fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and orthostatic intolerance). SUMMARY: We do not yet have a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which individuals develop post-COVID-19 conditions. There may be several distinct types of long COVID that require different treatments. At this point, there is no single pharmacologic agent to effectively treat all symptoms. Because some presentations of post-COVID-19 conditions mimic disorders such as ME/CFS, treatment guidelines for this and related conditions can be helpful for managing post-COVID-19 symptoms.

We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2-3\u00a0months later), integrated with clinical data and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved four PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific auto-antibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T\u00a0cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into four endotypes, exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time, leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC), usually referred to as 'Long COVID' (a phenotype of COVID-19), is a relatively frequent consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue, 'brain fog', tissue damage, inflammation, and coagulopathies (dysfunctions of the blood coagulation system) persist long after the initial infection. It bears similarities to other post-viral syndromes, and to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Many regulatory health bodies still do not recognize this syndrome as a separate disease entity, and refer to it under the broad terminology of 'COVID', although its demographics are quite different from those of acute COVID-19. A few years ago, we discovered that fibrinogen in blood can clot into an anomalous 'amyloid' form of fibrin that (like other \u03b2-rich amyloids and prions) is relatively resistant to proteolysis (fibrinolysis). The result, as is strongly manifested in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) of individuals with Long COVID, is extensive fibrin amyloid microclots that can persist, can entrap other proteins, and that may lead to the production of various autoantibodies. These microclots are more-or-less easily measured in PPP with the stain thioflavin T and a simple fluorescence microscope. Although the symptoms of Long COVID are multifarious, we here argue that the ability of these fibrin amyloid microclots (fibrinaloids) to block up capillaries, and thus to limit the passage of red blood cells and hence O2 exchange, can actually underpin the majority of these symptoms. Consistent with this, in a preliminary report, it has been shown that suitable and closely monitored 'triple' anticoagulant therapy that leads to the removal of the microclots also removes the other symptoms. Fibrin amyloid microclots represent a novel and potentially important target for both the understanding and treatment of Long COVID and related disorders.",

A mechanism, common to all, for this persistence of the range of symptoms common to these conditions is described. While TNF maintains cerebral homeostasis, its excessive production through either pathogen-associated molecular patterns or damage-associated molecular patterns activity associates with the persistence of the symptoms common across both infectious and non-infectious conditions. The case is made that this shared chronicity arises from a positive feedback loop causing the persistence of the activation of microglia by the TNF that these cells generate. Lowering this excess TNF is the logical way to reducing this persistent, TNF-maintained, microglial activation. While too large to negotiate the blood-brain barrier effectively, the specific anti-TNF biological, etanercept, shows promise when administered by the perispinal route, which allows it to bypass this obstruction.",

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether gut microbiome composition is linked to post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), defined as at least one persistent symptom 4\u2009weeks after clearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of 106 patients with a spectrum of COVID-19 severity followed up from admission to 6 months and 68 non-COVID-19 controls. We analysed serial faecal microbiome of 258 samples using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, and correlated the results with persistent symptoms at 6 months. RESULTS: At 6 months, 76% of patients had PACS and the most common symptoms were fatigue, poor memory and hair loss. Gut microbiota composition at admission was associated with occurrence of PACS. Patients without PACS showed recovered gut microbiome profile at 6 months comparable to that of non-COVID-19 controls. Gut microbiome of patients with PACS were characterised by higher levels of Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides vulgatus and lower levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Persistent respiratory symptoms were correlated with opportunistic gut pathogens, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and fatigue were correlated with nosocomial gut pathogens, including Clostridium innocuum and Actinomyces naeslundii (all p<0.05). Butyrate-producing bacteria, including Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii showed the largest inverse correlations with PACS at 6 months. CONCLUSION: These findings provided observational evidence of compositional alterations of gut microbiome in patients with long-term complications of COVID-19.

        "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Symptoms and hemodynamic findings during orthostatic stress have been reported in both long-haul COVID-19 and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), but little work has directly compared patients from these two groups. To investigate the overlap in these clinical phenotypes, we compared orthostatic symptoms in daily life and during head-up tilt, heart rate and blood pressure responses to tilt, and reductions in cerebral blood flow in response to orthostatic stress in long-haul COVID-19 patients, ME/CFS controls, and healthy controls. Materials and Methods: We compared 10 consecutive long-haul COVID-19 cases with 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) during head-up tilt, 20 age- and gender-matched ME/CFS controls with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to head-up tilt, and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Identical symptom questionnaires and tilt test procedures were used for all groups, including measurement of cerebral blood flow and cardiac index during the orthostatic stress. Results: There were no significant differences in ME/CFS symptom prevalence between the long-haul COVID-19 patients and the ME/CFS patients. All long-haul COVID-19 patients developed POTS during tilt. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index were more significantly reduced in the three patient groups compared with the healthy controls. Cardiac index reduction was not different between the three patient groups. The cerebral blood flow reduction was larger in the long-haul COVID-19 patients compared with the ME/CFS patients with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response. Conclusions: The symptoms of long-haul COVID-19 are similar to those of ME/CFS patients, as is the response to tilt testing. Cerebral blood flow and cardiac index reductions during tilt were more severely impaired than in many patients with ME/CFS. The finding of early-onset orthostatic intolerance symptoms, and the high pre-illness physical activity level of the long-haul COVID-19 patients, makes it unlikely that POTS in this group is due to deconditioning. These data suggest that similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 infection acts as a trigger for the development of ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "Impaired folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) is associated with many pathologies and developmental abnormalities. FOCM is a metabolic network of interdependent biosynthetic pathways that is known to be compartmentalized in the cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus. Currently, the biochemical mechanisms and causal metabolic pathways responsible for the initiation and/or progression of folate-associated pathologies have yet to be fully established. This review specifically examines the role of impaired FOCM in type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease and the emerging Long COVID/post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). Importantly, elevated homocysteine may be considered a biomarker for impaired FOCM, which is known to result in increased oxidative-redox stress. Therefore, the incorporation of hyperhomocysteinemia will be discussed in relation to impaired FOCM in each of the previously listed clinical diseases. This review is intended to fill gaps in knowledge associated with these clinical diseases and impaired FOCM. Additionally, some of the therapeutics will be discussed at this early time point in studying impaired FOCM in each of the above clinical disease states. It is hoped that this review will allow the reader to better understand the role of FOCM in the development and treatment of clinical disease states that may be associated with impaired FOCM and how to restore a more normal functional role for FOCM through improved nutrition and/or restoring the essential water-soluble B vitamins through oral supplementation.",

Only few mainly non-controlled studies with small sample size have evaluated long-term recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate symptoms and duration of 'long COVID' in children. A nationwide cohort study of 37,522 children aged 0-17\u00a0years with RT-PCR verified SARS-CoV-2 infection (response rate 44.9%) and a control group of 78,037 children (response rate 21.3%). An electronic questionnaire was sent to all children from March 24th until May 9th, 2021. Symptoms lasting\u2009>\u20094\u00a0weeks were common among both SARS-CoV-2 children and controls.

METHODS: A living systematic review. Medline, CINAHL (EBSCO), Global Health (Ovid), WHO Global Research on COVID-19 database, LitCovid and Google Scholar were searched till 17 March 2021. Studies including at least 100 people with confirmed or clinically suspected COVID-19 at 12 weeks or more post onset were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the tool produced by Hoy et al. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and meta-analyses to estimate prevalence. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were included: 32 cohort, 6 cross-sectional and 1 case-control. Most showed high or moderate risk of bias. None were set in low-income countries and few included children. Studies reported on 10\u2009951 people (48% female) in 12 countries. Most included previously hospitalised people (78%, 8520/10 951). The longest mean follow-up time was 221.7 (SD: 10.9) days post COVID-19 onset. Over 60 physical and psychological signs and symptoms with wide prevalence were reported, most commonly weakness (41%; 95%\u2009CI 25% to 59%), general malaise (33%; 95%\u2009CI 15% to 57%), fatigue (31%; 95%\u2009CI 24% to 39%), concentration impairment (26%; 95%\u2009CI 21% to 32%) and breathlessness (25%; 95%\u2009CI 18% to 34%). 37% (95% CI 18% to 60%) of patients reported reduced quality of life; 26% (10/39) of studies presented evidence of reduced pulmonary function.

A total of 558 (13.3%) participants reported symptoms lasting \u226528\u2009days, 189 (4.5%) for \u22658 weeks and 95 (2.3%) for \u226512 weeks. Long COVID was characterized by symptoms of fatigue, headache, dyspnea and anosmia and was more likely with increasing age and body mass index and female sex. Experiencing more than five symptoms during the first week of illness was associated with long COVID (odds ratio\u2009=\u20093.53 (2.76-4.50)). A simple model to distinguish between short COVID and long COVID at 7\u2009days (total sample size, n\u2009=\u20092,149) showed an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve of 76%, with replication in an independent sample of 2,472 individuals who were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. This model could be used to identify individuals at risk of long COVID for trials of prevention or treatment and to plan education and rehabilitation services.",

        "abstract": "The sudden outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV, later named SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, which rapidly grew into a global pandemic, marked the third introduction of a virulent coronavirus into the human society, affecting not only the healthcare system, but also the global economy. Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multifactorial illness that affects many body systems including the immune, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and urinary systems. There is currently no universal diagnostic marker or targeted treatment for ME/CFS. Urine is a non-invasive sample that provides biomarkers that may have the potential to be used in a diagnostic capacity for ME/CFS. While there are several studies investigating urine-based biomarkers for ME/CFS, there are no published systematic reviews to summarise existing evidence of these markers. The aim of this systematic review was to compile and appraise literature on urinary-based biomarkers in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Three databases: Embase, PubMed, and Scopus were searched for articles pertaining to urinary biomarkers for ME/CFS compared with healthy controls published between December 1994 to December 2022. The final articles included in this review were determined through application of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality and bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Control Studies. A meta-analysis according to Cochrane guidelines was conducted on select studies, in particular, those that investigate urinary\u00a0free cortisol levels in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls using the program STATA 17. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were included in this review. All of the studies investigated urinary-based markers in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls. The reported changes in urinary outputs include urinary free cortisol (38.10%), carnitine\u00a0(28.6%), iodine (4.76%), and the metabolome (42.86%). In most cases, there was\u00a0minimal overlap in the\u00a0main outcomes measured across the studies, however, differences in\u00a0urinary free cortisol\u00a0between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls\u00a0were\u00a0commonly reported.\u00a0Seven studies investigating urinary\u00a0free cortisol were included in the meta-analysis. While there were significant differences found in urinary\u00a0free cortisol levels in ME/CFS patients, there was also substantial heterogeneity across the included studies that makes drawing conclusions difficult. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence suggesting a consistent and specific potential urinary-based biomarker for ME/CFS. Further investigations using more standardised methodologies and more stringent case criteria may be able to identify pathophysiological differences\u00a0with diagnostic potential in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls.",

Specifically, the relationship between the immunologic, metabolic, and gastrointestinal abnormalities associated with ME/CFS and their relevance to established symptoms of the condition remain unclear. Relying on data from two independent pairs of ME/CFS and control cohorts, one at rest and one undergoing an exercise challenge, we identify a state of suppressed acute-phase innate immune response to microbial translocation in conjunction with a compromised gut epithelium in ME/CFS. This immunosuppression, along with observed enhancement of compensatory antibody responses to counter the microbial translocation, was associated with and may be mediated by alterations in glucose and citrate metabolism and an IL-10 immunoregulatory response. Our findings provide novel insights into mechanistic pathways, biomarkers, and potential therapeutic targets in ME/CFS, including in the context of exertion, with relevance to both intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms.",

There is currently no known diagnostic biomarker; instead, diagnosis is dependent on application of symptom-based case criteria following exclusion of any other potential medical conditions. While there are some studies that report potential biomarkers for ME/CFS, their efficacy has not been validated. The aim of this systematic review is to collate and appraise literature pertaining to a potential biomarker(s) which may effectively differentiate ME/CFS patients from healthy controls. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Cochrane review guidelines. PubMed, Embase and Scopus were systematically searched for articles containing \"biomarker\" and \"ME/CFS\" keywords in the abstract or title and if they included the following criteria: (1) were observational studies published between December 1994 and April 2022; (2) involved adult human participants; (3) full text is available in English (4) original research; (5) diagnosis of ME/CFS patients made according to the Fukuda criteria (1994), Canadian Consensus Criteria (2003), International Consensus Criteria (2011) or Institute of Medicine Criteria (2015); (6) study investigated potential biomarkers of ME/CFS compared to healthy controls. Quality and Bias were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Control Studies. RESULTS: A total of 101 publications were included in this systematic review. Potential biomarkers ranged from genetic/epigenetic (19.8%), immunological (29.7%), metabolomics/mitochondrial/microbiome (14.85%), endovascular/circulatory (17.82%), neurological (7.92%), ion channel (8.91%) and physical dysfunction biomarkers (8.91%). Most of the potential biomarkers reported were blood-based (79.2%). Use of lymphocytes as a model to investigate ME/CFS pathology was prominent among immune-based biomarkers. Most biomarkers had secondary (43.56%) or tertiary (54.47%) selectivity, which is the ability for the biomarker to identify a disease-causing agent, and a moderate (59.40%) to complex (39.60%) ease-of-detection, including the requirement of specialised equipment. CONCLUSIONS: All potential ME/CFS biomarkers differed in efficiency, quality, and translatability as a diagnostic marker. Reproducibility of findings between the included publications were limited, however, several studies validated the involvement of immune dysfunction in the pathology of ME/CFS and the use of lymphocytes as a model to investigate the pathomechanism of illness.

Cranial venous outflow obstruction has been proposed as the pathological substrate. We describe a patient with multiple symptoms, including headache and disabling fatigue, in which this model guided investigation and treatment. Specifically, CT and catheter venography identified focal narrowings of both jugular and the left brachiocephalic veins. Treatment of brachiocephalic obstruction was not feasible. However, in separate surgical procedures, relief of jugular venous obstruction produced incremental and significant clinical improvements which have proven durable over the length of follow-up. We suggest that investigating chronic fatigue syndrome under this model might not only bring benefit to individual patients but also will provide new insights into IIH and its relationship with spontaneous intracranial hypotension.",

The present study seeks to address this through a national, Internet-based survey targeting patients with severe and very severe ME/CFS and their carers. Responses from 491 patients were included, with 444 having severe and 47 very severe ME/CFS with the classification based on the best estimate from patient responses. In addition, 95 respondents were reclassified from patients' own classification to moderate and included for comparison. The onset was before 15 years of age for 45% in the very severe and 32% in the severe group. Disease duration was more than 15 years for 19% in the very severe and 27% in the severe group. Patient symptom burden was extensive. The most severely affected were totally bedridden, unable to talk, and experienced dramatic worsening of symptoms after minimal activity or sensory stimuli. Care and assistance from healthcare and social services were often described as insufficient or inadequate, often worsening the symptom load and burden of care. A substantial lack of disease knowledge among healthcare providers in general was reported. Yet approximately 60% in the severe and very severe groups found services provided by occupational therapists and family doctors (general practitioners) helpful, while a smaller proportion experienced appropriate help from other health personnel groups. This indicates that help and support are highly needed and possible to provide. On the other hand, this must be approached carefully, as a substantial number of patients experienced deterioration from contact with healthcare personnel. Family carers described an extensive burden of care with often inadequate help from healthcare providers or municipal authorities. Patient care by family members of very severe ME/CFS patients constituted more than 40 h a week for 71% of this patient group. The carers described a large negative impact on their work and financial situation, and on their mental wellbeing.

While the cause of this disease remains unknown, there is evidence of a potential infectious component that, along with patient symptoms and common onsets of the disease, implicates immune system dysfunction. To further our understanding of the state of ME/CFS lymphocytes, we characterized the role of fatty acids in isolated Natural Killer cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in circulation and after overnight stimulation, through implicit perturbations to fatty acid oxidation. We examined samples obtained from at least 8 and as many as 20 subjects for immune cell fatty acid characterization in a variety of experiments and found that all three isolated cell types increased their utilization of lipids and levels of pertinent proteins involved in this metabolic pathway in ME/CFS samples, particularly during higher energy demands and activation. In T cells, we characterized the cell populations contributing to these metabolic shifts, which included CD4+ memory cells, CD4+ effector cells, CD8+ na\u00efve cells, and CD8+ memory cells. We also discovered that patients with ME/CFS and healthy control samples had significant correlations between measurements of CD4+ T cell fatty acid metabolism and demographic data. These findings provide support for metabolic dysfunction in ME/CFS immune cells.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disease considered to be triggered by viral infections in a majority of cases. Symptoms overlap largely with those of post-acute sequelae of COVID-19/long-COVID implying common pathogenetic mechanisms. SARS-CoV-2 infection is risk factor for sustained latent virus reactivation that may account for the symptoms of post-viral fatigue syndromes. The aim of this study was first to investigate whether patients with ME/CFS and healthy donors (HDs) differed in their antibody response to mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondly, to analyze whether COVID-19 imposes latent virus reactivation in the cohorts. METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were analyzed in plasma and saliva from non-vaccinated ME/CFS (n=95) and HDs (n=110) using soluble multiplex immunoassay. Reactivation of human herpesviruses 1-6 (HSV1, HSV2, VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV6), and human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) was detected by anti-viral antibody fingerprints in saliva. RESULTS: At 3-6 months after mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, virus-specific antibodies in saliva were substantially induced signifying a strong reactivation of latent viruses (EBV, HHV6 and HERV-K) in both cohorts. In patients with ME/CFS, antibody responses were significantly stronger, in particular EBV-encoded nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA1) IgG were elevated in patients with ME/CFS, but not in HDs. EBV-VCA IgG was also elevated at baseline prior to SARS-infection in patients compared to HDs. CONCLUSION: Our results denote an altered and chronically aroused anti-viral profile against latent viruses in ME/CFS. SARS-CoV-2 infection even in its mild/asymptomatic form is a potent trigger for reactivation of latent herpesviruses (EBV, HHV6) and endogenous retroviruses (HERV-K), as detected by antibody fingerprints locally in the oral mucosa (saliva samples). This has not been shown before because the antibody elevation is not detected systemically in the circulation/plasma.",

Biomarkers that could facilitate the diagnosis of ME/CFS are not yet available; therefore, reliable and clinically useful disease indicators are of high importance. The aim of this work was to analyze the association between ME/CFS clinical course severity, presence of HHV-6A/B infection markers, and plasma levels of autoantibodies against adrenergic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. A total of 134 patients with ME/CFS and 33 healthy controls were analyzed for the presence of HHV-6A/B using PCRs, and antibodies against beta2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b22AdR) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3 AChR and M4 AChR) using ELISAs. HHV-6A/B U3 genomic sequence in whole-blood DNA was detected in 19/31 patients with severe ME/CFS, in 18/73 moderate ME/CFS cases, and in 7/30 mild ME/CFS cases. Severity-related differences were found among those with a virus load of more than 1,000 copies/106 PBMCs. Although no disease severity-related differences in anti-\u03b22AdR levels were observed in ME/CFS patients, the median concentration of these antibodies in plasma samples of ME/CFS patients was 1.4 ng/ml, while in healthy controls, it was 0.81 ng/ml, with a statistically significant increased level in those with ME/CFS (p = 0.0103). A significant difference of antibodies against M4 AChR median concentration was found between ME/CFS patients (8.15 ng/ml) and healthy controls (6.45 ng/ml) (p = 0.0250). The levels of anti-M4 plotted against disease severity did not show any difference; however, increased viral load correlates with the increase in anti-M4 level. ME/CFS patients with high HHV-6 load have a more severe course of the disease, thus confirming that the severity of the disease depends on the viral load-the course of the disease is more severe with a higher viral load. An increase in anti-M4 AchR and anti-\u03b22AdR levels is detected in all ME/CFS patient groups in comparison to the control group not depending on ME/CFS clinical course severity. However, the increase in HHV-6 load correlates with the increase in anti-M4 level, and the increase in anti-M4 level, in turn, is associated with the increase in anti-\u03b22AdR level. Elevated levels of antibodies against \u03b22AdR and M4 receptors in ME/CFS patients support their usage as clinical biomarkers in the diagnostic algorithm of ME/CFS.",

Older age at disease onset was associated with R/I (OR 1.06 [95% CI 1.007-1.110] (p = 0.028)), while diagnostic delay was inversely associated with R/I (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.964-0.996] (p = 0.036)).

        "abstract": "Ischaemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury, initiated via bursts of reactive oxygen species produced during the reoxygenation phase following hypoxia, is well known in a variety of acute circumstances. We argue here that I-R injury also underpins elements of the pathology of a variety of chronic, inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ME/CFS and, our chief focus and most proximally, Long COVID. Ischaemia may be initiated via fibrin amyloid microclot blockage of capillaries, for instance as exercise is started; reperfusion is a necessary corollary when it finishes. We rehearse the mechanistic evidence for these occurrences here, in terms of their manifestation as oxidative stress, hyperinflammation, mast cell activation, the production of marker metabolites and related activities. Such microclot-based phenomena can explain both the breathlessness/fatigue and the post-exertional malaise that may be observed in these conditions, as well as many other observables. The recognition of these processes implies, mechanistically, that therapeutic benefit is potentially to be had from antioxidants, from anti-inflammatories, from iron chelators, and via suitable, safe fibrinolytics, and/or anti-clotting agents. We review the considerable existing evidence that is consistent with this, and with the biochemical mechanisms involved.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ME/CFS is a disorder characterized by recurrent fatigue and intolerance to exertion which manifests as profound post-exertional malaise. Prevalence studies internationally have reported highly variable results due to the 20\u2009+\u2009diagnostic criteria. For Australia, the prevalence of ME/CFS based on current case definitions is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To report prevalence of ME/CFS in patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200913\u00a0years attending Australian primary care settings for years 2015-2019, and provide context for patterns of primary care attendance by people living with ME/CFS. METHODOLOGY: Conducted in partnership with the Patient Advisory Group, this study adopted a mixed methods approach. De-identified primary care data from the national MedicineInsight program were analyzed. The cohort were regularly attending patients, i.e. 3 visits in the preceding 2\u00a0years. Crude prevalence rates were calculated for years 2015-2019, by sex, 10-year age groups, remoteness and socioeconomic status. Rates are presented per 100,000population (95% confidence intervals (CI)). Qualitative data was collected through focus groups and in-depth 1:1 interview. RESULTS: Qualitative evidence identified barriers to reaching diagnosis, and limited interactions with primary care due to a lack of available treatments/interventions, stigma and disbelief in ME/CFS as a condition. In each year of interest, crude prevalence in the primary care setting ranged between 94.9/100,000 (95% CI: 91.5-98.5) and 103.9/100,000 population (95%CI: 100.3-107.7), equating to between 20,140 and 22,050 people living with ME/CFS in Australia in 2020. Higher rates were observed for age groups 50-59\u00a0years and 40-49\u00a0years. Rates were substantially higher in females (130.0-141.4/100,000) compared to males (50.9-57.5/100,000). In the context of the qualitative evidence, our prevalence rates likely represent an underestimate of the true prevalence of ME/CFS in the Australian primary care setting. CONCLUSION: ME/CFS affects a substantial number of Australians. Whilst this study provides prevalence estimates for the Australian primary care setting, the qualitative evidence highlights the limitations of these. Future research should focus on using robust case ascertainment criteria in a community setting. Quantification of the burden of disease can be used to inform health policy and planning, for this understudied condition.",

We used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphology and ultrastructure of unstimulated and stimulated ME/CFS immune cells and their intracellular organelles, including mitochondria. PBMCs from four participants were studied: a pair of identical twins discordant for moderate ME/CFS, as well as two age- and gender- matched unrelated subjects-one with an extremely severe form of ME/CFS and the other healthy. TEM analysis of CD3/CD28-stimulated T cells suggested a significant increase in the levels of apoptotic and necrotic cell death in T cells from ME/CFS patients (over 2-fold). Stimulated Tcells of ME/CFS patients also had higher numbers of swollen mitochondria. We also found a large increase in intracellular giant lipid droplet-like organelles in the stimulated PBMCs from the extremely severe ME/CFS patient potentially indicative of a lipid storage disorder. Lastly, we observed a slight increase in platelet aggregation in stimulated cells, suggestive of a possible role of platelet activity in ME/CFS pathophysiology and disease severity.

Using machine learning algorithms, we were able to differentiate ME/CFS or subgroups of ME/CFS from controls with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values up to 0.873. Our findings provide the first metabolomic evidence of peroxisomal dysfunction, and are consistent with dysregulation of lipid remodeling and the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-COVID syndrome (PCS) is an important sequela of COVID-19, characterised by symptom persistence for >3 months, post-acute symptom development, and worsening of pre-existing comorbidities. The causes and public health impact of PCS are still unclear, not least for the lack of efficient means to assess the presence and severity of PCS. METHODS: COVIDOM is a population-based cohort study of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, recruited through public health authorities in three German regions (Kiel, Berlin, W\u00fcrzburg) between November 15, 2020 and September 29, 2021. Main inclusion criteria were (i) a PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and (ii) a period of at least 6 months between the infection and the visit to the COVIDOM study site. Other inclusion criteria were written informed consent and age \u226518 years. Key exclusion criterion was an acute reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. Study site visits included standardised interviews, in-depth examination, and biomaterial procurement. In sub-cohort Kiel-I, a PCS (severity) score was developed based upon 12 long-term symptom complexes. Two validation sub-cohorts (W\u00fcrzburg/Berlin, Kiel-II) were used for PCS score replication and identification of clinically meaningful predictors. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04679584) and at the German Registry for Clinical Studies (DRKS, DRKS00023742). FINDINGS: In Kiel-I (n = 667, 57% women), 90% of participants had received outpatient treatment for acute COVID-19. Neurological ailments (61\u00b75%), fatigue (57\u00b71%), and sleep disturbance (57\u00b70%) were the most frequent persisting symptoms at 6-12 months after infection. Across sub-cohorts (W\u00fcrzburg/Berlin, n = 316, 52% women; Kiel-II, n = 459, 56% women), higher PCS scores were associated with lower health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L-VAS/-index: r = -0\u00b754/ -0\u00b756, all p\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b70001). Severe, moderate, and mild/no PCS according to the individual participant's PCS score occurred in 18\u00b78%, 48\u00b72%, and 32\u00b79%, respectively, of the Kiel-I sub-cohort. In both validation sub-cohorts, statistically significant predictors of the PCS score included the intensity of acute phase symptoms and the level of personal resilience. INTERPRETATION: PCS severity can be quantified by an easy-to-use symptom-based score reflecting acute phase disease burden and general psychological predisposition. The PCS score thus holds promise to facilitate the clinical diagnosis of PCS, scientific studies of its natural course, and the development of therapeutic interventions. FUNDING: The COVIDOM study is funded by the Network University Medicine (NUM) as part of the National Pandemic Cohort Network (NAPKON).",

To investigate pathophysiology of ME/CFS, several potential pathologic hallmarks have been investigated; however, these studies have failed to report a consistent result. These failures in introducing the underlying reason for ME/CFS have stimulated considering other possible contributing mechanisms such as tryptophan (TRP) metabolism and in particular kynurenine pathway (KP). KP plays a central role in cellular energy production through the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In addition, this pathway has been shown to mediate immune response and neuroinflammation through its metabolites.

An increasing number of studies have implicated the involvement of the immune system in ME/CFS. Furthermore, a hereditary component is suggested by the reported increased risk for disease in relatives, and genetic association studies are being performed to identify potential risk variants. We recently reported an association with the immunologically important human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes HLA-C and HLA-DQB1 in ME/CFS. Furthermore, a genome-wide genetic association study in 42 ME/CFS patients reported significant association signals with two variants in the T cell receptor alpha (TRA) locus (P value <5\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). As the T cell receptors interact with the HLA molecules, we aimed to replicate the previously reported findings in the TRA locus using a large Norwegian ME/CFS cohort (409 cases and 810 controls) and data from the UK biobank (2105 cases and 4786 controls). We investigated numerous SNPs in the TRA locus, including the two previously ME/CFS-associated variants, rs11157573 and rs17255510. No associations were observed in the Norwegian cohort, and there was no significant association with the two previously reported SNPs in any of the cohorts. However, other SNPs showed signs of association (P value <0.05) in the UK Biobank cohort and meta-analyses of Norwegian and UK biobank cohorts, but none survived correction for multiple testing. Hence, our research did not identify any reliable associations with variants in the TRA locus.",

Many diseases, such as gastrointestinal inflammation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), trigger neuroinflammation through several pathways. The mechanisms of action for peripheral inflammation-induced neuroinflammation include disruption of the blood-brain barrier, activation of glial cells associated with systemic immune activation, and effects on autonomic nerves via the organ-brain axis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is no approved pharmaceutical intervention for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Fatigue in these patients can last for decades. Long COVID may continue to ME/CFS, and currently, it is estimated that up to 20 million Americans have significant symptoms after COVID, and the most common symptom is fatigue. Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate, (AEO) a nutritional supplement, has been anecdotally reported to relieve physical and mental fatigue and is dimished in ME/CFS patients. Here, we examine the use of higher dosage AEO as a medical food to relieve pathological fatigue. METHODS: ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were enrolled in an open label dose escalating \"Proof of Concept\" non-randomized controlled clinical trial with 500\u00a0mg AEO capsules. Control was provided by a historical ME/CFS fatigue trial and supporting meta-analysis study, which showed average improvement with oral placebo using the Chalder Scale of 5.9% improvement from baseline. At baseline, 73.7% of the ME/CFS patients were women, average age was 47 and length of ME/CFS from diagnosis was 8.9\u00a0years. The Long-COVID patients were a random group that responded to social media advertising (Face Book) with symptoms for at least 6\u00a0months. ME/CFS patients were given separate doses of 500\u00a0mg BID (N\u2009=\u200923), 1,000\u00a0mg BID (N\u2009=\u200929) and 1000\u00a0mg TID (N\u2009=\u200924) AEO for six weeks. Long COVID patients were given 500\u00a0mg AEO BID (N\u2009=\u200922) and 1000\u00a0mg AEO (N\u2009=\u200921), again over a six-week period. The main outcome measure was to compare baseline scoring with results at 6\u00a0weeks with the Chalder Fatigue Score (Likert Scoring) versus historical placebo. The hypothesis being tested was formulated prior to data collection. RESULTS: 76 ME/CFS patients (73.7% women, median age of 47) showed an average reduction in fatigue at 6\u00a0weeks as measured by the \"Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire\" of 22.5% to 27.9% from baseline (P\u2009<\u20090.005) (Likert scoring). Both physical and mental fatigue were significantly improved over baseline and historical placebo. Fatigue amelioration in ME/CFS patients increased in a dose dependent manner from 21.7% for 500\u00a0mg BID to 27.6% for 1000\u00a0mg Oxaloacetate BID to 33.3% for 1000\u00a0mg TID. Long COVID patients' fatigue was significantly reduced by up to 46.8% in 6-weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Significant reductions in physical and metal fatigue for ME/CFS and Long-COVID patients were seen after 6\u00a0weeks of treatment. As there has been little progress in providing fatigue relief for the millions of ME/CFS and Long COVID patients, anhydrous enol oxaloacetate may bridge this important medical need.

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, complex, and highly debilitating long-term illness. People with ME/CFS are typically unable to carry out their routine activities. Key hallmarks of the disease are neurological and gastrointestinal impairments accompanied by pervasive malaise that is exacerbated after physical and/or mental activity. Currently, there is no validated cure of biomarker signature for this illness. Impaired tryptophan (TRYP) metabolism is thought to play significant role in the pathobiology of ME/CFS. TRYP is an important precursor for serotonin and the essential pyridine nucleotide nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). TRYP has been associated with the development of some parts of the brain responsible for behavioural functions. The main catabolic route for TRYP is the kynurenine pathway (KP). The KP produces NAD+ and several neuroactive metabolites with neuroprotective (i.e., kynurenic acid (KYNA)) and neurotoxic (i.e., quinolinic acid (QUIN)) activities. Hyperactivation of the KP, whether compensatory or a driving mechanism of degeneration can limit the availability of NAD+ and exacerbate the symptoms of ME/CFS. This review discusses the potential association of altered KP metabolism in ME/CFS. The review also evaluates the role of the patient's gut microbiota on TRYP availability and KP activation. We propose that strategies aimed at raising the levels of NAD+ (e.g., using nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinamide riboside) may be a promising intervention to overcome symptoms of fatigue and to improve the quality of life in patients with ME/CFS. Future clinical trials should further assess the potential benefits of NAD+ supplements for reducing some of the clinical features of ME/CFS.",

Several potential disease mechanisms have been identified, including immune abnormalities, inflammatory activation, mitochondrial alterations, endothelial and muscular disturbances, cardiovascular anomalies, and dysfunction of the peripheral and central nervous systems. Yet, it remains unclear whether and how these pathways may be related and orchestrated. Here we explore the hypothesis that a common denominator of the pathobiological processes in ME/CFS may be central nervous system dysfunction due to impaired or pathologically reactive neuroglia (astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes). We will test this hypothesis by reviewing, in reference to the current literature, the two most salient and widely accepted features of ME/CFS, and by investigating how these might be linked to dysfunctional neuroglia. From this review we conclude that the multifaceted pathobiology of ME/CFS may be attributable in a unifying manner to neuroglial dysfunction. Because the two key features - post exertional malaise and decreased cerebral blood flow - are also recognized in a subset of patients with post-acute sequelae COVID, we suggest that our findings may also be pertinent to this entity.",

Pharmacologic cholinergic stimulation was used to test the hypothesis that neurovascular dysregulation underlies exercise intolerance in ME/CFS. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does neurovascular dysregulation contribute to exercise intolerance in ME/CFS, and can its treatment improve exercise capacity? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five subjects with ME/CFS were enrolled in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 60-mg dose of oral pyridostigmine or placebo after an invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET). A second iCPET was performed 50\u00a0min later. The primary end point was the difference in peak exercise oxygen uptake (Vo2). Secondary end points included exercise pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics and gas exchange. RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects were assigned to receive pyridostigmine and 22 to receive placebo. The peak Vo2 increased after pyridostigmine but decreased after placebo (13.3 \u00b1 13.4\u00a0mL/min vs\u00a0-40.2 \u00b1 21.3\u00a0mL/min; P\u00a0< .05). The treatment effect of pyridostigmine was 53.6\u00a0mL/min (95%\u00a0CI, -105.2 to -2.0). Peak vs\u00a0rest Vo2 (25.9 \u00b1 15.3\u00a0mL/min vs\u00a0-60.8 \u00b1 25.6\u00a0mL/min; P\u00a0< .01), cardiac output (-0.2 \u00b1 0.6 L/min vs\u00a0-1.9 \u00b1 0.6 L/min; P\u00a0< .05), and right atrial pressure (1.0 \u00b1 0.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg vs\u00a0-0.6 \u00b1 0.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; P\u00a0< .05) were greater in the pyridostigmine group compared with placebo.

Despite intense investigation, the molecular mechanism of this disease is still unknown. Here we demonstrate that autophagy-related protein ATG13 is strongly upregulated in the serum of ME/CFS patients, indicative of impairment in the metabolic events of autophagy. A Thioflavin T-based protein aggregation assay, array screening for autophagy-related factors, densitometric analyses, and confirmation with ELISA revealed that the level of ATG13 was strongly elevated in serum samples of ME/CFS patients compared to age-matched controls. Moreover, our microglia-based oxidative stress response experiments indicated that serum samples of ME/CFS patients evoke the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide in human HMC3 microglial cells, whereas neutralization of ATG13 strongly diminishes the production of ROS and NO, suggesting that ATG13 plays a role in the observed stress response in microglial cells. Finally, an in vitro ligand binding assay provided evidence that ATG13 employs the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) to stimulate ROS in microglial cells. Collectively, our results suggest that an impairment of autophagy following the release of ATG13 into serum could be a pathological signal in ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and disabling disorder primarily characterized by persistent fatigue and exercise intolerance, with associated sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood but may coincide with immune and inflammatory responses following viral infections. During the current SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic, ME/CFS has been increasingly reported to overlap with persistent \"long COVID\" symptoms, also called the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Given the prominence of activity and sleep problems in ME/CFS, circadian rhythm disruption has been examined as a contributing factor in ME/CFS. While these studies of circadian rhythms have been pursued for decades, evidence linking circadian rhythms to ME/CFS remains inconclusive. A major limitation of older chronobiology studies of ME/CFS was the unavailability of modern molecular methods to study circadian rhythms and incomplete understanding of circadian rhythms outside the brain in peripheral organ systems. Major methodological and conceptual advancements in chronobiology have since been made. Over the same time, biomarker research in ME/CFS has progressed. Together, these new developments may justify renewed interest in circadian rhythm research in ME/CFS. Presently, we review ME/CFS from the perspective of circadian rhythms, covering both older and newer studies that make use of modern molecular methods. We focus on transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), a cytokine that has been previously associated with ME/CFS and has an important role in circadian rhythms, especially in peripheral cells. We propose that disrupted TGFB signaling in ME/CFS may play a role in disrupting physiological rhythms in sleep, activity, and cognition, leading to the insomnia, energy disturbances, cognition problems, depression, and autonomic dysfunction associated with ME/CFS. Since SARS-like coronavirus infections cause persistent changes in TGFB and previous coronavirus outbreaks have caused ME/CFS-like syndromes, chronobiological considerations may have immediate implications for understanding ME/CFS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions.",

We monitored the evolution of 1157 plasma metabolites in 60 ME/CFS (45 female, 15 male) and 45 matched healthy control participants (30 female, 15 male) before and after 2 maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) challenges separated by 24 hours, with the intent of provoking PEM in patients. Four time points allowed exploration of the metabolic response to maximal energy-producing capacity and the recovery pattern of participants with ME/CFS compared with the healthy control group. Baseline comparison identified several significantly different metabolites, along with an enriched percentage of yet-to-be identified compounds. Additionally, temporal measures demonstrated an increased metabolic disparity between cohorts, including unknown metabolites. The effects of exertion in the ME/CFS cohort predominantly highlighted lipid-related as well as energy-related pathways and chemical structure clusters, which were disparately affected by the first and second exercise sessions. The 24-hour recovery period was distinct in the ME/CFS cohort, with over a quarter of the identified pathways statistically different from the controls. The pathways that are uniquely different 24 hours after an exercise challenge provide clues to metabolic disruptions that lead to PEM. Numerous altered pathways were observed to depend on glutamate metabolism, a crucial component of the homeostasis of many organs in the body, including the brain.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: About 10% of individuals who contract infectious mononucleosis (IM) have symptoms 6 months later that meet criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Our study for the first time examined whether it is possible to predict who will develop ME/CFS following IM. METHODS: We have reported on a prospectively recruited cohort of 4,501 college students, of which 238 (5.3%) developed IM. Those who developed IM were followed-up at six months to determine whether they recovered or met criteria for ME/CFS. The present study focuses on 48 students who after six months had a diagnosis of ME/CFS, and a matched control group of 58 students who had no further symptoms after their IM. All of these 106 students had data at baseline (at least 6 weeks prior to the development of IM), when experiencing IM, and 6 months following IM. Of those who did not recover from IM, there were two groups: 30 were classified as ME/CFS and 18 were classified as severe ME/CFS. We measured the results of 7 questionnaires, physical examination findings, the severity of mononucleosis and cytokine analyses at baseline (pre-illness) and at the time of IM. We examined predictors (e.g., pre-illness variables as well as variables at onset of IM) of those who developed ME/CFS and severe ME/CFS following IM. RESULTS: From analyses using receiver operating characteristic statistics, the students who had had severe gastrointestinal symptoms of stomach pain, bloating, and an irritable bowel at baseline and who also had abnormally low levels of the immune markers IL-13 and/or IL-5 at baseline, as well as severe gastrointestinal symptoms when then contracted IM, were found to have a nearly 80% chance of having severe ME/CFS persisting six months following IM. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with emerging literature that gastrointestinal distress and autonomic symptoms, along with several immune markers, may be implicated in the development of severe ME/CFS.",

Hereditability is suggested by an increased disease risk in relatives, however, genome-wide association studies in ME/CFS have been limited by small sample sizes and broad diagnostic criteria, therefore no established risk loci exist to date. In this study, we have analyzed three ME/CFS cohorts: a Norwegian discovery cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a0427), a Danish replication cohort (N\u00a0=\u00a0460) and a replication dataset from the UK biobank (N\u00a0=\u00a02105). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ME/CFS genome-wide association study of this magnitude incorporating 2532 patients for the genome-wide analyses and 460 patients for a targeted analysis. Even so, we did not find any ME/CFS risk loci displaying genome-wide significance. In the Norwegian discovery cohort, the TPPP gene region showed the most significant association (rs115523291, P\u00a0=\u00a08.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-7), but we could not replicate the top SNP. However, several other SNPs in the TPPP gene identified in the Norwegian discovery cohort showed modest association signals in the self-reported UK biobank CFS cohort, which was also present in the combined analysis of the Norwegian and UK biobank cohorts, TPPP (rs139264145; P\u00a0=\u00a00.00004). Interestingly, TPPP is expressed in brain tissues, hence it will be interesting to see whether this association, with time, will be verified in even larger cohorts.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue, exertion intolerance and post-exertional malaise are among the most frequent symptoms of Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS), with a subset of patients fulfilling criteria for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). As SARS-CoV-2 infects endothelial cells, causing endotheliitis and damaging the endothelium, we investigated endothelial dysfunction (ED) and endothelial biomarkers in patients with PCS. METHODS: We studied the endothelial function in 30 PCS patients with persistent fatigue and exertion intolerance as well as in 15 age- and sex matched seronegative healthy controls (HCs). 14 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The other patients were considered to have PCS. Peripheral endothelial function was assessed by the reactive hyperaemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) in patients and HCs. In a larger cohort of patients and HCs, including post-COVID reconvalescents (PCHCs), Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Endocan (ESM-1), IL-8, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 were analysed as endothelial biomarkers. RESULTS: Five of the 14 post-COVID ME/CFS patients and five of the 16 PCS patients showed ED defined by a diminished RHI (<\u20091.67), but none of HCs exhibited this finding. A paradoxical positive correlation of RHI with age, blood pressure and BMI was found in PCS but not ME/CFS patients. The ET-1 concentration was significantly elevated in both ME/CFS and PCS patients compared to HCs and PCHCs. The serum Ang-2 concentration was lower in both PCS patients and PCHCs compared to HCs. CONCLUSION: A subset of PCS patients display evidence for ED shown by a diminished RHI and altered endothelial biomarkers. Different associations of the RHI with clinical parameters as well as varying biomarker profiles may suggest distinct pathomechanisms among patient subgroups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing has demonstrated clinical utility in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). However, to what extent exercise responses are independent of, or confounded by, aerobic fitness remains unclear. PURPOSE: To characterize and compare exercise responses in ME/CFS and controls with and without matching for aerobic fitness. METHODS: As part of the Multi-site Clinical Assessment of ME/CFS (MCAM) study, 403 participants (n = 214 ME/CFS; n = 189 controls), across six ME/CFS clinics, completed ramped cycle ergometry to volitional exhaustion. Metabolic, heart rate (HR), and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. Ventilatory equivalent ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]), metrics of ventilatory efficiency, and chronotropic incompetence (CI) were calculated. Exercise variables were compared using Hedges' g effect size with 95% confidence intervals. Differences in cardiopulmonary and perceptual features during exercise were analyzed using linear mixed effects models with repeated measures for relative exercise intensity (20-100% peak [Formula: see text]). Subgroup analyses were conducted for 198 participants (99 ME/CFS; 99 controls) matched for age (\u00b15 years) and peak [Formula: see text] (~1 ml/kg/min-1). RESULTS: Ninety percent of tests (n = 194 ME/CFS, n = 169 controls) met standard criteria for peak effort. ME/CFS responses during exercise (20-100% peak [Formula: see text]) were significantly lower for ventilation, breathing frequency, HR, measures of efficiency, and CI and significantly higher for [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and RPE (p<0.05adjusted). For the fitness-matched subgroup, differences remained for breathing frequency, [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and RPE (p<0.05adjusted), and higher tidal volumes were identified for ME/CFS (p<0.05adjusted). Exercise responses at the gas exchange threshold, peak, and for measures of ventilatory efficiency (e.g., [Formula: see text]) were generally reflective of those seen throughout exercise (i.e., 20-100%). CONCLUSION: Compared to fitness-matched controls, cardiopulmonary responses to exercise in ME/CFS are characterized by inefficient exercise ventilation and augmented perception of effort.

Despite reported associations between ME/CFS onset and exposure to infectious agents (viral, bacterial, or fungal), the pathophysiology of ME/CFS remains unknown. In this prevalence study, we investigated the rates of Aspergillus-derived toxin levels, Aflatoxin (AF), Ochratoxin A (OTA), and Gliotoxin (GT), in the urinalysis of 236 ME/CFS patients with a history of chronic exposure to mold (i.e., from water-damaged buildings). Among ME/CFS patients reporting chronic exposure to mold, we found evidence of exposure in 92.4 percent of patients, with OTA being the most prevalent mycotoxin. Mold distributions (OTA, AF, and GT) in the urinalysis all demonstrated right skewness, while the distribution of age of ME/CFS patients diagnosed showed no deviation from normality. This study aims to provide preliminary, epidemiological evidence among ME/CFS patients who were diagnosed in South Florida with a history of exposure to mycotoxins.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious disorder of unknown aetiology. While the pathomechanism of ME/CFS remains elusive, reduced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic function is a consistent immunological feature. NK cell effector functions rely on long-term sustained calcium (Ca2+) influx. In recent years evidence of transient receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) dysfunction supports the hypothesis that ME/CFS is potentially an ion channel disorder. Specifically, reports of single nucleotide polymorphisms, low surface expression and impaired function of TRPM3 have been reported in NK cells of ME/CFS patients. It has been reported that mu (\u00b5)-opioid receptor (\u00b5OR) agonists, known collectively as opioids, inhibit TRPM3. Naltrexone hydrochloride (NTX), a \u00b5OR antagonist, negates the inhibitory action of \u00b5OR on TRPM3 function. Importantly, it has recently been reported that NTX restores impaired TRPM3 function in NK cells of ME/CFS patients. METHODS: Live cell immunofluorescent imaging was used to measure TRPM3-dependent Ca2+ influx in NK cells isolated from n\u2009=\u200910 ME/CFS patients and n\u2009=\u200910 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) following modulation with TRPM3-agonist, pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) and TRPM3-antaognist, ononetin. The effect of overnight (24\u00a0h) NTX in vitro treatment on TRPM3-dependent Ca2+ influx was determined. RESULTS: The amplitude (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and half-time of Ca2+ response (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) was significantly reduced at baseline in NK cells of ME/CFS patients compared with HC. Overnight treatment of NK cells with NTX significantly improved TRPM3-dependent Ca2+ influx in ME/CFS patients. Specifically, there was no significance between HC and ME/CFS patients for half-time response, and the amplitude of Ca2+ influx was significantly increased in ME/CFS patients (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSION: TRPM3-dependent Ca2+ influx was restored in ME/CFS patients following overnight treatment of isolated NK cells with NTX in vitro. Collectively, these findings validate that TRPM3 loss of function results in altered Ca2+ influx supporting the growing evidence that ME/CFS is a TRP ion channel disorder and that NTX provides a potential therapeutic intervention for ME/CFS.",

Along with clinical studies showing endothelial dysfunction (ED) in a subset of ME/CFS patients, we have recently reported altered ED-related microRNAs in plasma from affected individuals. Inadequate nitric oxide (NO), mainly produced by the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in endothelial cells (ECs), is a major cause of ED. In this study, we hypothesized that plasma from that cohort of ME/CFS patients induces eNOS-related ED in vitro. To test this, we cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the presence of plasma from either ME/CFS patients (ME/CFS-plasma, n\u00a0=\u00a011) or healthy controls (HC-plasma, n\u00a0=\u00a012). Then, we measured the NO production in the absence and presence of tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors agonists (TKRs and GPCRs, respectively), well-known to activate eNOS in ECs. Our data showed that HUVECs incubated with ME/CFS-plasma produced less NO either in the absence or presence of eNOS activators compared to ones in presence of HC-plasma. Also, the NO production elicited by bradykinin, histamine, and acetylcholine (GPCRs agonists) was more affected than the one triggered by insulin (TKR agonist). Finally, inhibitory eNOS phosphorylation at Thr495 was higher in HUVECs treated with ME/CFS-plasma compared to the same treatment with HC-plasma. In conclusion, this study in vitro shows a decreased NO production in HUVECs exposed to plasma from ME/CFS patients, suggesting an unreported role of eNOS in the pathophysiology of this disease.",

OI has a high prevalence in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Limited data are available to guide the treatment of OI in ME/CFS patients. We and others have previously described patient-reported subjective improvement in symptoms using compression stockings. We hypothesized that these subjective reports would be accompanied by objective hemodynamic improvements. Materials and Methods: We performed a randomized crossover trial in 16 ME/CFS patients. Each underwent two 15-min head-up tilt table tests, one with and one without wearing knee-high compression stockings that provided 20-25 mm Hg compression. The order of the tests was randomized. We measured heart rate and blood pressure as well as cardiac output and cerebral blood flow (CBF) using extracranial Doppler of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Results: There were no differences in supine measurements between the 2 baseline measurements. There were no differences in heart rate and blood pressure at either end-tilt testing period.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic and debilitating disease that is characterized by unexplained physical fatigue unrelieved by rest. Symptoms also include cognitive and sensory dysfunction, sleeping disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, and gastrointestinal problems. A syndrome clinically similar to ME/CFS has been reported following well-documented infections with the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. At least 10% of COVID-19 survivors develop post acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Although many individuals with PASC have evidence of structural organ damage, a subset have symptoms consistent with ME/CFS including fatigue, post exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and postural orthostatic intolerance. These common features in ME/CFS and PASC suggest that insights into the pathogenesis of either may enrich our understanding of both syndromes, and could expedite the development of strategies for identifying those at risk and interventions that prevent or mitigate disease. METHODS: Using regression, Bayesian and enrichment analyses, we conducted targeted and untargeted metabolomic analysis of 888 metabolic analytes in plasma samples of 106 ME/CFS cases and 91 frequency-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: In ME/CFS cases, regression, Bayesian and enrichment analyses revealed evidence of peroxisomal dysfunction with decreased levels of plasmalogens. Other findings included decreased levels of several membrane lipids, including phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins, that may indicate dysregulation of the cytidine-5\u00e2\u20ac\u2122-diphosphocholine pathway. Enrichment analyses revealed decreased levels of choline, ceramides and carnitines, and increased levels of long chain triglycerides (TG) and hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid. Elevated levels of dicarboxylic acids were consistent with abnormalities in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Using machine learning algorithms with selected metabolites as predictors, we were able to differentiate female ME/CFS cases from female controls (highest AUC=0.794) and ME/CFS cases without self-reported irritable bowel syndrome (sr-IBS) from controls without sr-IBS (highest AUC=0.873). CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with earlier ME/CFS work indicating compromised energy metabolism and redox imbalance, and highlight new abnormalities that may provide insights into the pathogenesis of ME/CFS.

We developed a provocation paradigm with two submaximal bicycle exercise stress tests on consecutive days bracketed by magnetic resonance imaging, orthostatic intolerance, and symptom assessments before and after exercise in order to induce objective changes of exercise induced symptom exacerbation and cognitive dysfunction. Method: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) scans were performed while at rest on the preexercise and postexercise days in 34 ME/CFS and 24 control subjects. Seed regions from the FSL data library with significant BOLD signals were nodes that clustered into networks using independent component analysis. Differences in signal amplitudes between groups on pre- and post-exercise days were determined by general linear model and ANOVA. Results: The most striking exercise-induced effect in ME/CFS was the increased spontaneous activity in the medial prefrontal cortex that is the anterior node of the Default Mode Network (DMN). In contrast, this region had decreased activation for controls. Overall, controls had higher BOLD signals suggesting reduced global cerebral blood flow in ME/CFS. Conclusion: The dynamic increase in activation of the anterior DMN node after exercise may be a biomarker of postexertional malaise and symptom exacerbation in CFS. The specificity of this postexertional finding in ME/CFS can now be assessed by comparison to post-COVID fatigue, Gulf War Illness, fibromyalgia, chronic idiopathic fatigue, and fatigue in systemic medical and psychiatric diseases.",

        "abstract": "We here provide an overview of the pathophysiological mechanisms during heat stroke and describe similar mechanisms found in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Both conditions are characterized by disturbed homeostasis in which inflammatory pathways play a central role. Splanchnic vasoconstriction, increased gut permeability, gut-related endotoxemia, systemic inflammatory response, central nervous system dysfunction, blood coagulation disorder, endothelial-cell injury, and mitochondrial dysfunction underlie heat stroke. These mechanisms have also been documented in ME/CFS. Moreover, initial transcriptomic studies suggest that similar gene expressions are altered in both heat stroke and ME/CFS. Finally, some predisposing factors for heat stroke, such as pre-existing inflammation or infection, overlap with those for ME/CFS. Notwithstanding important differences - and despite heat stroke being an acute condition - the overlaps between heat stroke and ME/CFS suggest common pathways in the physiological responses to very different forms of stressors, which are manifested in different clinical outcomes. The human studies and animal models of heat stroke provide an explanation for the self-perpetuation of homeostatic imbalance centered around intestinal wall injury, which could also inform the understanding of ME/CFS. Moreover, the studies of novel therapeutics for heat stroke might provide new avenues for the treatment of ME/CFS. Future research should be conducted to investigate the similarities between heat stroke and ME/CFS to help identify the potential treatments for ME/CFS.",

Owing to its highly multifaceted nature, this review proposes and characterises six subtypes of PCS based on the existing literature. The subtypes are non-severe COVID-19 multi-organ sequelae (NSC-MOS), pulmonary fibrosis sequelae (PFS), myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) and medical or clinical sequelae (MCS).

We report briefly the growing knowledge of the underlying pathological processes in ME/CFS, and the development of new organizations, including Doctors with ME, the US ME/CFS Clinical Coalition and EUROMENE, to address aspects of the challenges posed by the illness. We discuss the implications of COVID-19, which has much in common with ME/CFS, with much overlap of symptoms, and propose a new taxonomic category, which we are terming post-active phase of infection syndromes (PAPIS) to include both. This collection of papers includes a number of papers reporting similar serious impacts on the quality of life of patients and their families in various European countries. The advice of EUROMENE experts on diagnosis and management is included in the collection. We report this in light of guidance from other parts of the world, including the USA and Australia, and in the context of current difficulties in the UK over the promulgation of a revised guideline from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). We also consider evidence on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for ME/CFS, and on the difficulties of determining the costs of care when a high proportion of people with ME/CFS are never diagnosed as such. The Special Issue includes a paper which is a reminder of the importance of a person-centred approach to care by reviewing mind-body interventions.

Sleep profiles and cognitive tests revealed distinctive impairments. Lower morning cortisol level and alterations in its diurnal rhythm were observed in the patients, and antibody and antigen measurements showed no evidence for acute infections by common viral or bacterial pathogens.

Materials and methods: Total of 65 Caucasian patients from an ambulatory care setting were included in the study. Questionnaires, specialist evaluation of the patients and visual analogue scale (VAS) measurements were used to objectify the findings. Results: The study showed that ME/CFS with comorbidities is associated with a more severe disease. A negative correlation was found regarding an increase in age and number of current symptoms, as well as an increase in VAS score and the duration of fatigue and age in the ME/CFS without comorbidities group. Conclusions: Comorbidities tend to present with a more severe course of ME/CFS. Fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia and sleep disturbances tend to be more prevalent in the ME/CFS patients compared to the non-ME/CFS patients.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multi-symptom disease with widespread evidence of disrupted systems. The authors hypothesize that it is caused by the upregulation of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor type 2 (CRFR2) in the raph\u00e9 nuclei and limbic system, which impairs the ability to maintain homeostasis. The authors propose utilizing agonist-mediated receptor endocytosis to downregulate CRFR2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label trial tested the safety, tolerability and efficacy of an acute dose of CT38s (a short-lived, CRFR2-selective agonist, with no known off-target activity) in 14 ME/CFS patients. CT38s was subcutaneously-infused at one of four dose-levels (i.e., infusion rates of 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, and 0.20 \u03bcg/kg/h), for a maximum of 10.5 h. Effect was measured as the pre-/post-treatment change in the mean 28-day total daily symptom score (TDSS), which aggregated 13 individual patient-reported symptoms. RESULTS: ME/CFS patients were significantly more sensitive to the transient hemodynamic effects of CRFR2 stimulation than healthy subjects in a prior trial, supporting the hypothesized CRFR2 upregulation. Adverse events were generally mild, resolved without intervention, and difficult to distinguish from ME/CFS symptoms, supporting a CRFR2 role in the disease. The acute dose of CT38s was associated with an improvement in mean TDSS that was sustained (over at least 28 days post-treatment) and correlated with both total exposure and pre-treatment symptom severity. At an infusion rate of 0.03 \u03bcg/kg/h, mean TDSS improved by -7.5 \u00b1 1.9 (or -25.7%, p = 0.009), with all monitored symptoms improving. CONCLUSION: The trial supports the hypothesis that CRFR2 is upregulated in ME/CFS, and that acute CRFR2 agonism may be a viable treatment approach warranting further study.

        "abstract": "Despite myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) affecting millions of people worldwide, many clinicians lack the knowledge to appropriately diagnose or manage ME/CFS. Unfortunately, clinical guidance has been scarce, obsolete, or potentially harmful. Consequently, up to 91% of patients in the United States remain undiagnosed, and those diagnosed often receive inappropriate treatment. These problems are of increasing importance because after acute COVID-19, a significant percentage of people remain ill for many months with an illness similar to ME/CFS. In 2015, the US National Academy of Medicine published new evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria that have been adopted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Furthermore, the United States and other governments as well as major health care organizations have recently withdrawn graded exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the treatment of choice for patients with ME/CFS. Recently, 21 clinicians specializing in ME/CFS convened to discuss best clinical practices for adults affected by ME/CFS. This article summarizes their top recommendations for generalist and specialist health care providers based on recent scientific progress and decades of clinical experience. There are many steps that clinicians can take to improve the health, function, and quality of life of those with ME/CFS, including those in whom ME/CFS develops after COVID-19. Patients with a lingering illness that follows acute COVID-19 who do not fully meet criteria for ME/CFS may also benefit from these approaches.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex illness which disproportionally affects females. This illness is associated with immune and metabolic perturbations that may be influenced by lipid metabolism. We therefore hypothesized that plasma lipids from ME/CFS patients will provide a unique biomarker signature of disturbances in immune, inflammation and metabolic processes associated with ME/CFS. METHODS: Lipidomic analyses were performed on plasma from a cohort of 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 controls (50% males and similar age and ethnicity per group). Analyses were conducted with nano-flow liquid chromatography (nLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems coupled with a high mass accuracy ORBITRAP mass spectrometer, allowing detection of plasma lipid concentration ranges over three orders of magnitude. We examined plasma phospholipids (PL), neutral lipids (NL) and bioactive lipids in ME/CFS patients and controls and examined the influence of sex on the relationship between lipids and ME/CFS diagnosis. RESULTS: Among females, levels of total phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), omega-6 arachidonic acid-containing PE, and total hexosylceramides (HexCer) were significantly decreased in ME/CFS compared to controls. In males, levels of total HexCer, monounsaturated PE, phosphatidylinositol (PI), and saturated triglycerides (TG) were increased in ME/CFS patients compared to controls. Additionally, omega-6 linoleic acid-derived oxylipins were significantly increased in male ME/CFS patients versus male controls. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three major components containing mostly PC and a few PE, PI and SM species-all of which were negatively associated with headache and fatigue severity, irrespective of sex. Correlations of oxylipins, ethanolamides and ME/CFS symptom severity showed that lower concentrations of these lipids corresponded with an increase in the severity of headaches, fatigue and cognitive difficulties and that this association was influenced by sex. CONCLUSION: The observed sex-specific pattern of dysregulated PL, NL, HexCer and oxylipins in ME/CFS patients suggests a possible role of these lipids in promoting immune dysfunction and inflammation which may be among the underlying factors driving the clinical presentation of fatigue, chronic pain, and cognitive difficulties in ill patients. Further evaluation of lipid metabolism pathways is warranted to better understand ME/CFS pathogenesis.",

Emerging evidence supports that energy metabolism is affected in ME/CFS, but a unifying metabolic phenotype has not been firmly established. We performed global metabolomics, lipidomics, and hormone measurements, and we used exploratory data analyses to compare serum from 83 patients with ME/CFS and 35 healthy controls. Some changes were common in the patient group, and these were compatible with effects of elevated energy strain and altered utilization of fatty acids and amino acids as catabolic fuels. In addition, a set of heterogeneous effects reflected specific changes in 3 subsets of patients, and 2 of these expressed characteristic contexts of deregulated energy metabolism. The biological relevance of these metabolic phenotypes (metabotypes) was supported by clinical data and independent blood analyses. In summary, we report a map of common and context-dependent metabolic changes in ME/CFS, and some of them presented possible associations with clinical patient profiles. We suggest that elevated energy strain may result from exertion-triggered tissue hypoxia and lead to systemic metabolic adaptation and compensation. Through various mechanisms, such metabolic dysfunction represents a likely mediator of key symptoms in ME/CFS and possibly a target for supportive intervention.",

Enteroviruses (EVs) as a cause of ME/CFS have sometimes been proposed, as they are known agents of acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infections that may persist in secondary infection sites, including the central nervous system, muscle, and heart. To date, the body of research that has investigated enterovirus infections in relation to ME/CFS supports an increased prevalence of chronic or persistent enteroviral infections in ME/CFS patient cohorts than in healthy individuals. Nevertheless, inconsistent results have fueled a decline in related studies over the past two decades. This review covers the aspects of ME/CFS pathophysiology that are consistent with a chronic enterovirus infection and critically reviews methodologies and approaches used in past EV-related ME/CFS studies. We describe the prior sample types that were interrogated, the methods used and the limitations to the approaches that were chosen. We conclude that there is considerable evidence that prior outbreaks of ME/CFS were caused by one or more enterovirus groups. Furthermore, we find that the methods used in prior studies were inadequate to rule out the presence of chronic enteroviral infections in individuals with ME/CFS.

We performed a comprehensive cellular assessment using bioenergetics (extracellular flux analysis) and protein profiles (quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics) together with self-reported symptom measures of fatigue, ANS dysfunction, and overall physical and mental well-being. This ME/CFS cohort presented with severe fatigue, which correlated with the severity of ANS dysfunction and overall physical well-being. PBMCs from ME/CFS patients showed significantly lower mitochondrial coupling efficiency. They exhibited proteome alterations, including altered mitochondrial metabolism, centred on pyruvate dehydrogenase and coenzyme A metabolism, leading to a decreased capacity to provide adequate intracellular ATP levels.

The presence of persistent fatigue and impaired daily physical and cognitive function has led to speculation that like SARS-CoV-1 infection, COVID-19 will be followed by myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Methods and Results: We describe three adolescent and young adult patients who had confirmed or probable COVID-19 infections early on during the pandemic and were referred for evaluation to the Chronic Fatigue Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center. All patients reported orthostatic intolerance symptoms within the first 2 weeks of illness, and 10-min passive standing tests were consistent with postural tachycardia syndrome. After 6 months of illness, all three patients met criteria for ME/CFS. Clinical features of interest included strong histories of allergies in all three patients, two of whom had elevations in plasma histamine. Each demonstrated limitations in symptom-free range of motion of the limbs and spine and two presented with pathological Hoffman reflexes. These comorbid features have been reported in adolescents and young adults with ME/CFS. Conclusion: ME/CFS can be triggered by COVID-19 in adolescents and young adults. Further work is needed to determine the pathogenesis of ME/CFS after COVID-19 and optimal methods of treating these patients. Our preliminary study calls attention to several comorbid features that deserve further attention as potential targets for intervention. These include neuromuscular limitations that could be treated with manual forms of therapy, orthostatic intolerance and POTS for which there are multiple medications and non-pharmacologic therapies, treatable allergic and mast cell phenomena, and neurologic abnormalities that may require specific treatment. Larger studies will need to ascertain the prevalence of these abnormalities.",

A functional measure to assess muscle fatigability of ME/CFS patients is, however, not established in clinical routine. The aim of this study is to evaluate by assessing repeat maximum handgrip strength (HGS), muscle fatigability as a diagnostic tool and its correlation with clinical parameters. METHODS: We assessed the HGS of 105 patients with ME/CFS, 18 patients with Cancer related fatigue (CRF) and 66 healthy controls (HC) using an electric dynamometer assessing maximal (Fmax) and mean force (Fmean) of ten repetitive measurements. Results were correlated with clinical parameters, creatinine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Further, maximum isometric quadriceps strength measurement was conducted in eight ME/CFS patients and eight HC. RESULTS: ME/CFS patients have a significantly lower Fmax and Fmean HGS compared to HC (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Further, Fatigue Ratio assessing decline in strength during repeat maximal HGS measurement (Fmax/Fmean) was higher (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0012). The Recovery Ratio after an identical second testing 60\u00a0min later was significantly lower in ME/CFS compared to HC (Fmean2/Fmean1; p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0020). Lower HGS parameters correlated with severity of disease, post-exertional malaise and muscle pain and with higher CK and LDH levels after exertion. CONCLUSION: Repeat HGS assessment is a sensitive diagnostic test to assess muscular fatigue and fatigability and an objective measure to assess disease severity in ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "Since 2012, studies in mice, rats, and humans have suggested that abnormalities in purinergic signaling may be a final common pathway for many genetic and environmental causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study in mice was conducted to characterize the bioenergetic, metabolomic, breathomic, and behavioral features of acute hyperpurinergia triggered by systemic injection of the purinergic agonist and danger signal, extracellular ATP (eATP). Responses were studied in C57BL/6J mice in the maternal immune activation (MIA) model and controls. Basal metabolic rates and locomotor activity were measured in CLAMS cages. Plasma metabolomics measured 401 metabolites. Breathomics measured 98 volatile organic compounds. Intraperitoneal eATP dropped basal metabolic rate measured by whole body oxygen consumption by 74% \u00b1 6% (mean \u00b1 SEM) and rectal temperature by 6.2\u02da \u00b1 0.3\u02daC in 30 minutes. Over 200 metabolites from 37 different biochemical pathways where changed. Breathomics showed an increase in exhaled carbon monoxide, dimethylsulfide, and isoprene. Metabolomics revealed an acute increase in lactate, citrate, purines, urea, dopamine, eicosanoids, microbiome metabolites, oxidized glutathione, thiamine, niacinamide, and pyridoxic acid, and decreased folate-methylation-1-carbon intermediates, amino acids, short and medium chain acyl-carnitines, phospholipids, ceramides, sphingomyelins, cholesterol, bile acids, and vitamin D similar to some children with ASD. MIA animals were hypersensitive to postnatal exposure to eATP or poly(IC), which produced a rebound increase in body temperature that lasted several weeks before returning to baseline. Acute hyperpurinergia produced metabolic and behavioral changes in mice. The behaviors and metabolic changes produced by ATP injection were associated with mitochondrial functional changes that were profound but reversible.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating illness, characterised by persistent fatigue that is unrelieved by rest, in combination with a range of other disabling symptoms. There is no diagnostic test nor targeted treatment available for this illness. The pathomechanism also\u00a0remains unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunctions have been considered a possible underlying pathology based on reported differences including structural and functional changes in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls. Due to the potential role that mitochondria may play in ME/CFS, mitochondrial-targeting nutraceutical interventions have been used to potentially assist in improving patient outcomes such as fatigue. The aim of this systematic review is to appraise literature assessing these nutraceuticals as a possible intervention for treating ME/CFS. METHODS: A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, Medline (EBSCO host) and Web of Science (via Clarivate Analytics) for journal articles published between January 1995 and 10th November 2020 was conducted. Articles assessing nutraceutical interventions and ME/CFS patient outcomes were retrieved. Using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, the list of articles was further refined. Quality was measured using the Rosendal scale. RESULTS: Nine intervention studies were included in this review. The studies investigated patient symptom severity changes such as altered fatigue levels in response to mitochondrial-targeting nutraceuticals. Improvements in fatigue levels were observed in six of the nine studies. Secondary outcomes assessed include biochemical, psychological, and quality of life parameters. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of mitochondria- targeting nutraceuticals in ME/CFS patients. Future well-designed studies are required to elucidate both the involvement of mitochondria in the pathomechanism of ME/CFS and the effect of mitochondrial-modifying agents on illness severity.",

The papers identified were reviewed following the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) methodology, and were classified according to the focus of the enquiry (patients, GPs, database and medical record studies, evaluation of a training programme, and overview papers), and whether they were quantitative or qualitative in nature; Results: Thirty-three papers were identified in the MEDLINE search. The quantitative surveys of GPs demonstrated that a third to a half of all GPs did not accept ME/CFS as a genuine clinical entity and, even when they did, they lacked confidence in diagnosing or managing it. It should be noted, though, that these papers were mostly from the United Kingdom. Patient surveys indicated that a similar proportion of patients was dissatisfied with the primary medical care they had received. These findings were consistent with the findings of the qualitative studies that were examined, and have changed little over several decades; Conclusions: Disbelief and lack of knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS among GPs is widespread, and the resultant diagnostic delays constitute a risk factor for severe and prolonged disease. Failure to diagnose ME/CFS renders problematic attempts to determine its prevalence, and hence its economic impact.",

        "abstract": "We propose a framework for understanding and interpreting the pathophysiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) that considers wider determinants of health and long-term temporal variation in pathophysiological features and disease phenotype throughout the natural history of the disease. As in other chronic diseases, ME/CFS evolves through different stages, from asymptomatic predisposition, progressing to a prodromal stage, and then to symptomatic disease. Disease incidence depends on genetic makeup and environment factors, the exposure to singular or repeated insults, and the nature of the host response. In people who develop ME/CFS, normal homeostatic processes in response to adverse insults may be replaced by aberrant responses leading to dysfunctional states. Thus, the predominantly neuro-immune manifestations, underlined by a hyper-metabolic state, that characterize early disease, may be followed by various processes leading to multi-systemic abnormalities and related symptoms. This abnormal state and the effects of a range of mediators such as products of oxidative and nitrosamine stress, may lead to progressive cell and metabolic dysfunction culminating in a hypometabolic state with low energy production. These processes do not seem to happen uniformly; although a spiraling of progressive inter-related and self-sustaining abnormalities may ensue, reversion to states of milder abnormalities is possible if the host is able to restate responses to improve homeostatic equilibrium. With time variation in disease presentation, no single ME/CFS case description, set of diagnostic criteria, or molecular feature is currently representative of all patients at different disease stages. While acknowledging its limitations due to the incomplete research evidence, we suggest the proposed framework may support future research design and health care interventions for people with ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In a study of 429 adults with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), we demonstrated that 86% had symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in daily life. Using extracranial Doppler measurements of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries during a 30-min head-up tilt to 70 degrees, 90% had an abnormal reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). A standard head-up tilt test of this duration might not be tolerated by the most severely affected bed-ridden ME/CFS patients. This study examined whether a shorter 15-min test at a lower 20 degree tilt angle would be sufficient to provoke reductions in cerebral blood flow in severe ME/CFS patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen severe ME/CFS patients with orthostatic intolerance complaints in daily life were studied: 18 females. The mean (SD) age was 35(14) years, body surface area (BSA) was 1.8(0.2) m2 and BMI was 24.0(5.4) kg/m2. The median disease duration was 14 (IQR 5-18) years. Heart rate increased, and stroke volume index and end-tidal CO2 decreased significantly during the test (p ranging from <0.001 to <0.0001). The cardiac index decreased by 26(7)%: p < 0.0001. CBF decreased from 617(72) to 452(63) mL/min, a 27(5)% decline. All 19 severely affected ME/CFS patients met the criteria for an abnormal CBF reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Using a less demanding 20 degree tilt test for 15 min in severe ME/CFS patients resulted in a mean CBF decline of 27%. This is comparable to the mean 26% decline previously noted in less severely affected patients studied during a 30-min 70 degree head-up tilt. These observations have implications for the evaluation and treatment of severely affected individuals with ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multifactorial disorder with many possible triggers. Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7 are two infectious triggers for which evidence has been growing. To understand possible causative role of HHV-6 in ME/CFS, metabolic and antiviral phenotypes of U2-OS cells were studied with and without chromosomally integrated HHV-6 and with or without virus reactivation using the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A. Proteomic analysis was conducted by pulsed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture analysis. Antiviral properties that were induced by HHV-6 transactivation were studied in virus-naive A549 cells challenged by infection with influenza-A (H1N1) or HSV-1. Mitochondria were fragmented and 1-carbon metabolism, dUTPase, and thymidylate synthase were strongly induced by HHV-6 reactivation, whereas superoxide dismutase 2 and proteins required for mitochondrial oxidation of fatty acid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, were strongly inhibited. Adoptive transfer of U2-OS cell supernatants after reactivation of HHV-6A led to an antiviral state in A549 cells that prevented superinfection with influenza-A and HSV-1. Adoptive transfer of serum from 10 patients with ME/CFS produced a similar fragmentation of mitochondria and the associated antiviral state in the A549 cell assay. In conclusion, HHV-6 reactivation in ME/CFS patients activates a multisystem, proinflammatory, cell danger response that protects against certain RNA and DNA virus infections but comes at the cost of mitochondrial fragmentation and severely compromised energy metabolism.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The underlying hypothesis in orthostatic intolerance (OI) syndromes is that symptoms are associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) reduction. Indirect CBF measurements (transcranial Doppler flow velocities), provide inconsistent support of this hypothesis. The aim of the study was to measure CBF during a 30\u202fmin head-up tilt test (HUT), using Doppler flow imaging of carotid and vertebral arteries, in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), a condition with a high prevalence of OI. METHODS: 429 ME/CFS patients were studied: 247 had a normal heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) response to HUT, 62 had delayed orthostatic hypotension (dOH), and 120 had postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). We also studied 44 healthy controls (HC). CBF measurements were made at mid-tilt and end-tilt. Before mid-tilt, we administered a verbal questionnaire to ascertain for 15 OI symptoms. RESULTS: End-tilt CBF reduction was 7% in HC versus 26% in the overall ME/CFS group, 24% in patients with a normal HR/BP response, 28% in those with dOH, and 29% in POTS patients (all P\u202f<\u202f.0005). Using a lower limit of normal of 2SD of CBF reduction in HC (13% reduction), 82% of patients with normal HR/BP response, 98% with dOH and 100% with POTS showed an abnormal CBF reduction. There was a linear correlation of summed OI symptoms with the degree of CBF reduction at mid-tilt (P\u202f<\u202f.0005). CONCLUSIONS: During HUT, extracranial Doppler measurements demonstrate that CBF is reduced in ME/CFS patients with POTS, dOH, and even in those without HR/BP abnormalities. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that orthostatic intolerance symptoms are related to CBF reduction, and that the majority of ME/CFS patients (90%) show an abnormal cerebral flow reduction during orthostatic stress testing. This may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS patients.",

        "abstract": "This paper is written for non-specialists in mitochondrial biology to provide access to an important area of science that has broad implications for all people. The cell danger response (CDR) is a universal response to environmental threat or injury. Once triggered, healing cannot be completed until the choreographed stages of the CDR are returned to an updated state of readiness. Although the CDR is a cellular response, it has the power to change human thought and behavior, child development, physical fitness and resilience, fertility, and the susceptibility of entire populations to disease. Mitochondria regulate the CDR by monitoring and responding to the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions within and around the cell. In this way, mitochondria connect cellular health to environmental health. Over 7,000 chemicals are now made or imported to the US for industrial, agricultural, and personal care use in amounts ranging from 25,000 to over 1 million pounds each year, and plastic waste now exceeds 83 billion pounds/year. This chemical load creates a rising tide of manmade pollutants in the oceans, air, water, and food chain. Fewer than 5% of these chemicals have been tested for developmental toxicity. In the 1980s, 5-10% of children lived with a chronic illness. As of 2018, 40% of children, 50% of teens, 60% of adults under age 65, and 90% of adults over 65 live with a chronic illness. Several studies now report the presence of dozens to hundreds of manmade chemicals and pollutants in placenta, umbilical cord blood, and newborn blood spots. New methods in metabolomics and exposomics allow scientists to measure thousands of chemicals in blood, air, water, soil, and the food chain.

We analyzed glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in resting and activated T cells, along with markers related to cellular metabolism and plasma cytokines. We found that ME/CFS CD8+ T cells had reduced mitochondrial membrane potential compared with those from healthy controls. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with ME/CFS had reduced glycolysis at rest, whereas CD8+ T cells also had reduced glycolysis following activation. Patients with ME/CFS had significant correlations between measures of T cell metabolism and plasma cytokine abundance that differed from correlations seen in healthy control subjects.

Other outcomes evaluated in NK cells of ME/CFS patients, however, remain equivocal. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature regarding NK cell phenotype, receptor expression, cytokine production and cytotoxicity in ME/CFS patients and determine the appropriateness as a model for ME/CFS. METHODS: Medline (EBSCOHost), Scopus, EMBASE and PubMed databases were systematically searched to source relevant papers published between 1994 and March 2018. This review included studies examining NK cells' features in ME/CFS patients compared with HC following administration of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Secondary outcomes included genetic analysis in isolated NK cells or quality of life assessment. Quality assessment was completed using the Downs and Black checklist in addition to The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. RESULTS: Seventeen eligible publications were included in this review. All studies were observational case control studies. Of these, 11 investigated NK cell cytotoxicity, 14 investigated NK cell phenotype and receptor profiles, three examined NK cell cytokine production, six investigated NK cell lytic protein levels and four investigated NK cell degranulation. Impaired NK cell cytotoxicity remained the most consistent immunological report across all publications. Other outcomes investigated differed between studies. CONCLUSION: A consistent finding among all papers included in this review was impaired NK cell cytotoxicity, suggesting that it is a reliable and appropriate cellular model for continued research in ME/CFS patients. Aberrations in NK cell lytic protein levels were also reported. Although additional research is recommended, current research provides a foundation for subsequent investigations.

        "abstract": "The underlying molecular basis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is not well understood. Characterized by chronic, unexplained fatigue, a disabling payback following exertion (\"post-exertional malaise\"), and variably presenting multi-system symptoms, ME/CFS is a complex disease, which demands a concerted biomedical investigation from disparate fields of expertise. ME/CFS research and patient treatment have been challenged by the lack of diagnostic biomarkers and finding these is a prominent direction of current work. Despite these challenges, modern research demonstrates a tangible biomedical basis for the disorder across many body systems. This evidence is mostly comprised of disturbances to immunological and inflammatory pathways, autonomic and neurological dysfunction, abnormalities in muscle and mitochondrial function, shifts in metabolism, and gut physiology or gut microbiota disturbances. It is possible that these threads are together entangled as parts of an underlying molecular pathology reflecting a far-reaching homeostatic shift. Due to the variability of non-overlapping symptom presentation or precipitating events, such as infection or other bodily stresses, the initiation of body-wide pathological cascades with similar outcomes stemming from different causes may be implicated in the condition. Patient stratification to account for this heterogeneity is therefore one important consideration during exploration of potential diagnostic developments.",

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition with unknown aetiology, Myalgic encephalomyelitis unclear pathophysiology and with no diagnostic test or biomarker available. Many patients report their ME/CFS began after an acute infection, and subsequent increased frequency of infections, such as colds or influenza, is common. These factors imply an altered immunological status exists in ME/CFS, in at least a proportion of patients, yet previous studies of peripheral immunity have been discrepant and inconclusive. The UK ME/CFS Biobank, which has collected blood samples from nearly 300 clinically-confirmed ME/CFS patients, enables large-scale studies of immunological function in phenotypically well-characterised participants. In this study, herpes virus serological status and T cell, B cell, NK cell and monocyte populations were investigated in 251 ME/CFS patients, including 54 who were severely affected, and compared with those from 107 healthy participants and with 46 patients with Multiple Sclerosis. There were no differences in seroprevalence for six human herpes viruses between ME/CFS and healthy controls, although seroprevalence for the Epstein-Barr virus was higher in multiple sclerosis patients. Contrary to previous reports, no significant differences were observed in NK cell numbers, subtype proportions or in vitro responsiveness between ME/CFS patients and healthy control participants. In contrast, the T cell compartment was altered in ME/CFS, with increased proportions of effector memory CD8+ T cells and decreased proportions of terminally differentiated effector CD8+ T cells. Conversely, there was a significantly increased proportion of mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT) cells, especially in severely affected ME/CFS patients. These abnormalities demonstrate that an altered immunological state does exist in ME/CFS, particularly in severely affected people. This may simply reflect ongoing or recent infection, or may indicate future increased susceptibility to infection. Longitudinal studies of ME/CFS patients are needed to help to determine cause and effect and thus any potential benefits of immuno-modulatory treatments for ME/CFS.",

The molecular aberrations observed in numerous studies of ME/CFS blood cells offer the opportunity to develop a diagnostic assay from blood samples.

To pursue the goal of developing a reliable biomarker for ME/CFS and to demonstrate the utility of our platform for point-of-care diagnostics, we validated the array by testing patients with moderate to severe ME/CFS patients and healthy controls. The ME/CFS samples' response to the hyperosmotic stressor observed as a unique characteristic of the impedance pattern and dramatically different from the response observed among the control samples. We believe the observed robust impedance modulation difference of the samples in response to hyperosmotic stress can potentially provide us with a unique indicator of ME/CFS.

The frequency of diagnosis was 519-1,038/100,000 with the relative risk of females being diagnosed with ME or CFS compared to males 1.238 and 1.178, respectively. While the percentage of women diagnosed with ME/CFS is higher than the percentage of men, ME/CFS is not a \"women's disease.\" Thirty-five to forty percent of diagnosed patients are men. Extrapolating from this frequency of diagnosis and based on the estimated 2017 population of the United States, a rough estimate for the number of patients who may be diagnosed with ME or CFS in the U.S. is 1.7 million to 3.38 million. Patients diagnosed with CFS appear to represent a more heterogeneous group than those diagnosed with ME. A machine learning model based on characteristics of individuals diagnosed with ME was developed and applied, resulting in a predicted prevalence of 857/100,000 (p > 0.01), or roughly 2.8 million in the U.S. Average annual costs for individuals with a diagnosis of ME or CFS were compared with those for lupus (all categories) and multiple sclerosis (MS), and found to be 50% higher for ME and CFS than for lupus or MS, and three to four times higher than for the general insured population. A separate aspect of the study attempted to determine if a diagnosis of ME or CFS could be predicted based on symptom codes in the insurance claims records. Due to the absence of specific codes for some core symptoms, we were unable to validate that the information in insurance claims records is sufficient to identify diagnosed patients or suggest that a diagnosis of ME or CFS should be considered based solely on looking for presence of those symptoms. These results show that a prevalence rate of 857/100,000 for ME/CFS is not unreasonable; therefore, it is not a rare disease, but in fact a relatively common one.",

        "abstract": "Background: The diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS) in research and clinical practice has largely relied on clinical history, which can be subjective in nature. Clinical signs are often subtle, overlap with other conditions, and are not formally included as part of diagnostic workup. The characterization of clinical signs and biomarkers is needed for better diagnosis and classification of patients and to monitor treatment response. Hand grip strength (HGS) has been used as an objective measure of muscle strength and fatigue, which is a primary symptom of ME/CFS. We assessed the potential usefulness of HGS as a diagnostic marker in ME/CFS. Methods: We compared HGS measurements from participants in the UK ME/CFS Biobank, with groups consisting of people with ME/CFS of differing severity (n = 272), healthy (n = 136), multiple sclerosis (n = 76) controls, and others with chronic fatigue not meeting the diagnosis of ME/CFS (n = 37). We correlated the maximum and minimum of, and differences between, 3 repeated HGS measurements with parameters of disease severity, including fatigue and pain analog scales, and physical and mental component summaries from the SF-36v2TM questionnaire across recruitment groups. Results: HGS indicators were associated with having ME/CFS, with magnitudes of association stronger in severely affected than in mild/moderately affected patients. Compared with healthy controls, being severely affected was associated with a reduction in minimum HGS of 15.3 kg (95%CI 19.3-11.3; p < 0.001), while being mild/moderately affected was associated with a 10.5 kg (95%CI 13.2-7.8; p < 0.001) reduction. The association persisted after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index. ME/CFS cases also showed lower values of maximum HGS and significant drops in values from the first to second and third trials, compared to other study groups. There were significant correlations between HGS indicators and clinical parameters of disease severity, including fatigue analog scale (Spearman's Rho = -0.40, p < 0.001), pain analog scale (Rho = -0.38, p < 0.001), and physical component summary (Rho = 0.42, p < 0.001). Discussion: HGS is markedly reduced in ME/CFS, particularly in patients with more severe disease, and may indicate muscle and fatigue related symptoms. HGS is a potential diagnostic tool in ME/CFS, and could also be used to enhance patient phenotyping and as an outcome measure following interventions.",

However, lack of large studies involving well-designed patient groups and validated experimental set ups have hindered our knowledge about this disease. Moreover, recent developments regarding molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of various infectious agents cast doubts over validity of several of the past studies.

Mitochondrial and energetic dysfunction has been investigated in CFS patients due to a hallmark relationship with fatigue; however, no consistent conclusion has yet been achieved. Single-cell Raman spectra (SCRS) are label-free biochemical profiles, indicating phenotypic fingerprints of single cells. In this study, we applied a new approach using single-cell Raman microspectroscopy (SCRM) to examine \u03c10 cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CFS patients and healthy controls. The experimental results show that Raman bands associated with phenylalanine in \u03c10 cells and CFS patient PBMCs were significantly higher than those of the wild-type model and healthy controls. As similar changes were observed in the \u03c10 cell model with a known deficiency in the mitochondrial respiratory chain as well as in CFS patients, our results suggest that the increase in cellular phenylalanine may be related to mitochondrial/energetic dysfunction in both systems. Interestingly, phenylalanine can be used as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of CFS by SCRM. A machine learning classification model achieved an accuracy rate of 98% correctly assigning Raman spectra to either the CFS group or the control group. SCRM combined with a machine learning algorithm therefore has the potential to become a diagnostic tool for CFS.",

        "abstract": "Without healing, multicellular life on Earth would not exist. Without healing, one injury predisposes to another, leading to disability, chronic disease, accelerated aging, and death. Over 60% of adults and 30% of children and teens in the United States now live with a chronic illness. Advances in mass spectrometry and metabolomics have given scientists a new lens for studying health and disease. This study defines the healing cycle in metabolic terms and reframes the pathophysiology of chronic illness as the result of metabolic signaling abnormalities that block healing and cause the normal stages of the cell danger response (CDR) to persist abnormally. Once an injury occurs, active progress through the stages of healing is driven by sequential changes in cellular bioenergetics and the disposition of oxygen and carbon skeletons used for fuel, signaling, defense, repair, and recovery. >100 chronic illnesses can be organized into three persistent stages of the CDR. One hundred and two targetable chemosensory G-protein coupled and ionotropic receptors are presented that regulate the CDR and healing. Metabokines are signaling molecules derived from metabolism that regulate these receptors. Reframing the pathogenesis of chronic illness in this way, as a systems problem that maintains disease, rather than focusing on remote trigger(s) that caused the initial injury, permits new research to focus on novel signaling therapies to unblock the healing cycle, and restore health when other approaches have failed.",

CFS/ME is characterised by unexplicable disabling fatigue and is often also associated with numerous core symptoms. A growing body of evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in cell-to-cell communication, and are involved in both physiological and pathological processes. To date, no data on EV biology in CFS/ME are as yet available. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterise blood-derived EVs in CFS/ME. Blood samples were collected from 10 Spanish CFS/ME patients and 5 matched healthy controls (HCs), and EVs were isolated from the serum using a polymer-based method. Their protein cargo, size distribution and concentration were measured by Western blot and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Furthermore, EVs were detected using a lateral flow immunoassay based on biomarkers CD9 and CD63. We found that the amount of EV-enriched fraction was significantly higher in CFS/ME subjects than in HCs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and that EVs were significantly smaller in CFS/ME patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Circulating EVs could be an emerging tool for biomedical research in CFS/ME. These findings provide preliminary evidence that blood-derived EVs may distinguish CFS/ME patients from HCs.

METHODS: This study introduces the weighted standing time (WST) as a proxy for ME/CFS severity, and investigates its behaviour in an Australian cohort. WST was calculated from standing time and subjective standing difficulty data, collected via orthostatic intolerance assessments. The distribution of WST for healthy controls and ME/CFS patients was correlated with the clinical criteria, as well as pathology and cytokine markers. Included in the WST cytokine analyses were activins A and B, cytokines causally linked to inflammation, and previously demonstrated to separate ME/CFS from healthy controls. Forty-five ME/CFS patients were recruited from the CFS Discovery Clinic (Victoria) between 2011 and 2013. Seventeen healthy controls were recruited concurrently and identically assessed. RESULTS: WST distribution was significantly different between ME/CFS participants and controls, with six diagnostic criteria, five analytes and one cytokine also significantly different when comparing severity via WST. On direct comparison of ME/CFS to study controls, only serum activin B was significantly elevated, with no significant variation observed for a broad range of serum and urine markers, or other serum cytokines. CONCLUSIONS: The enhanced understanding of standing test behaviour to reflect orthostatic intolerance as a ME/CFS symptom, and the subsequent calculation of WST, will encourage the greater implementation of this simple test as a measure of ME/CFS diagnosis, and symptom severity, to the benefit of improved diagnosis and guidance for potential treatments.",

Immune dysregulation in ME/CFS has been frequently described including changes in cytokine profiles and immunoglobulin levels, T- and B-cell phenotype and a decrease of natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, autoantibodies against various antigens including neurotransmitter receptors have been recently identified in ME/CFS individuals by several groups.

High-throughput methods now allow us to interrogate the human immune system for multiple markers of inflammation at a scale that was not previously possible. To determine whether a signature of serum cytokines could be associated with ME/CFS and correlated with disease severity and fatigue duration, cytokines of 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls were measured using a 51-multiplex array on a Luminex system. Each cytokine's preprocessed data were regressed on ME/CFS severity plus covariates for age, sex, race, and an assay property of newly discovered importance: nonspecific binding. On average, TGF-\u03b2 was elevated (P = 0.0052) and resistin was lower (P = 0.0052) in patients compared with controls.

CFS/ME is a disease with complex, wide-ranging symptoms, featuring persistent fatigue of 6\u00a0months or longer, particularly post exertion. No definitive biomarkers are available. METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study of CFS/ME patients fulfilling the 2003 Canadian Consensus Criteria, in parallel with healthy non-fatigued controls, was conducted. Comparisons with a previously defined activin reference population were also performed. For the total study cohort the age range was 18-65\u00a0years with a female: male participant ratio of greater than 3:1. All participants were assessed via a primary care community clinic. Blood samples were collected for pathology testing after physical examination and orthostatic intolerance assessment.

Diagnosis is based on a list of symptoms and exclusion of other fatigue-related health conditions. Despite a heterogeneous patient population, immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function differences, such as enhanced negative feedback to glucocorticoids, are recurring findings in ME/CFS studies. Epigenetic modifications, such as CpG methylation, are known to regulate long-term phenotypic differences and previous work by our group found DNA methylome differences in ME/CFS, however the relationship between DNA methylome modifications, clinical and functional characteristics associated with ME/CFS has not been examined. METHODS: We examined the DNA methylome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a larger cohort of female ME/CFS patients using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Array. In parallel to the DNA methylome analysis, we investigated in vitro glucocorticoid sensitivity differences by stimulating PBMCs with phytohaemagglutinin and suppressed growth with dexamethasone. We explored DNA methylation differences using bisulfite pyrosequencing and statistical permutation. Linear regression was implemented to discover epigenomic regions associated with self-reported quality of life and network analysis of gene ontology terms to biologically contextualize results. RESULTS: We detected 12,608 differentially methylated sites between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls predominantly localized to cellular metabolism genes, some of which were also related to self-reported quality of life health scores. Among ME/CFS patients, glucocorticoid sensitivity was associated with differential methylation at 13 loci. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate DNA methylation modifications in cellular metabolism in ME/CFS despite a heterogeneous patient population, implicating these processes in immune and HPA axis dysfunction in ME/CFS.

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a complex, heterogeneous illness of unknown etiology. The search for biomarkers that can delineate cases from controls is one of the most active areas of ME research; however, little progress has been made in achieving this goal. In contrast to identifying biomarkers that are directly involved in the pathological process, an immunosignature identifies antibodies raised to proteins expressed during, and potentially involved in, the pathological process. Although these proteins might be unknown, it is possible to detect antibodies that react to these proteins using random peptide arrays. In the present study, we probe a custom 125,000 random 12-mer peptide microarray with sera from 21 ME cases and 21 controls from the USA and Europe and used these data to develop a diagnostic signature. We further used these peptide sequences to potentially uncover the naturally occurring candidate antigens to which these antibodies may specifically react with in vivo. Our analysis revealed a subset of 25 peptides that distinguished cases and controls with high specificity and sensitivity. Additionally, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches suggest that these peptides primarily represent human self-antigens and endogenous retroviral sequences and, to a minor extent, viral and bacterial pathogens.",

An area of investigation is the likely connection of CFS with defective mitochondrial function. In a previous work, we investigated the proteomic salivary profile in a couple of monozygotic twins discordant for CFS. Following this work, we analyzed mitochondrial proteins in the same couple of twins. Nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS) was used to study the mitochondria extracted from platelets of the twins. Subsequently, we selected three proteins that were validated using western blot analysis in a big cohort of subjects (n=45 CFS; n=45 healthy), using whole saliva (WS). The selected proteins were as follows: aconitate hydratase (ACON), ATP synthase subunit beta (ATPB) and malate dehydrogenase (MDHM). Results for ATPB and ACON confirmed their upregulation in CFS. However, the MDHM alteration was not confirmed. Thereafter, seeing the great variability of clinical features of CFS patients, we decided to analyze the expression of our proteins after splitting patients according to clinical parameters. For each marker, the values were actually higher in the group of patients who had clinical features similar to the ill twin. In conclusion, these results suggest that our potential markers could be one of the criteria to be taken into account for helping in diagnosis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common debilitating disorder associated with an intense fatigue, a reduced physical activity, and an impaired quality of life. There are no established biological markerof the syndrome. The etiology is unknown and its pathogenesis appears to be multifactorial. Various stressors, including intense physical activity, severe infection, and emotional stress are reported in the medical history of ME/CFS patients which raises the question whether any physiological and biological abnormalities usually found in these patients could be indicative of the etiology and/or the quality-of-life impairment. METHODS: Thirty-six patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The following variables that appear to address common symptoms of ME/CFS were studied here: (1) muscle fatigue during exercise has been investigated by monitoring the compound muscle action potential (M-wave); (2) the excessive oxidative stress response to exercise was measured via two plasma markers (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances: TBARS; reduced ascorbic-acid: RAA); (3) a potential inflammatory component was addressed via expression of CD26 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells; (4) quality-of-life impairment was assessed using the London Handicap Scale (LHS) and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 (SF-36). The medical history of each patient, including the presence of stressors such as intense sports practice, severe acute infection and/or severe emotional stress was documented. RESULTS: We observed that: (1) there were striking differences between cases and controls with regard to three biological variables: post-exercise M-wave, TBARS variations and CD26-expression at rest; (2) each of these three variables correlated with the other two; (3) abnormalities in the biomarkers associated with health-related quality of life: the LHS score was negatively correlated with the exercise-induced TBARS increase and positively correlated with CD26-expression while the pain component of SF-36 was negatively correlated with CD26-expression; (4) the TBARS increase and the M-wave decrease were the highest, and the CD26-expression level the lowest in patients who had been submitted to infectious stressors. CONCLUSION: In ME/CFS patients, severe alterations of the muscle excitability, the redox status, as well as the CD26-expression level are correlated with a marked impairment of the quality-of-life. They are particularly significant when infectious stressors are reported in the medical history.",

Previous studies have demonstrated the potential of Vis-NIR spectroscopy for diagnosing CFS by analyzing either serum samples as an invasive approach or thumbs as a non\u2011invasive approach. Analysis of the Vis\u2011NIR spectra of blood and thumbs suggested that factors absorbing in this spectral region are altered in patients with CFS compared with healthy individuals.

However, whether ME/CFS is associated with an altered microbiome has remained uncertain. Here, we profiled gut microbial diversity by sequencing 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes from stool as well as inflammatory markers from serum for cases (n\u2009=\u200948) and controls (n\u2009=\u200939). We also examined a set of inflammatory markers in blood: C-reactive protein (CRP), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein (LBP), and soluble CD14 (sCD14). RESULTS: We observed elevated levels of some blood markers for microbial translocation in ME/CFS patients; levels of LPS, LBP, and sCD14 were elevated in ME/CFS subjects. Levels of LBP correlated with LPS and sCD14 and LPS levels correlated with sCD14. Through deep sequencing of bacterial rRNA markers, we identified differences between the gut microbiomes of healthy individuals and patients with ME/CFS. We observed that bacterial diversity was decreased in the ME/CFS specimens compared to controls, in particular, a reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of members belonging to the Firmicutes phylum. In the patient cohort, we find less diversity as well as increases in specific species often reported to be pro-inflammatory species and reduction in species frequently described as anti-inflammatory. Using a machine learning approach trained on the data obtained from 16S rRNA and inflammatory markers, individuals were classified correctly as ME/CFS with a cross-validation accuracy of 82.93\u00a0%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in this disease and further suggest an increased incidence of microbial translocation, which may play a role in inflammatory symptoms in ME/CFS.",

Rintatolimod is a restricted Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist lacking activation of other primary cellular inducers of innate immunity (e.g.- cytosolic helicases). Rintatolimod also activates interferon induced proteins that require dsRNA for activity (e.g.- 2'-5' adenylate synthetase, protein kinase R). Rintatolimod has achieved statistically significant improvements in primary endpoints in Phase II and Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a generally well tolerated safety profile and supported by open-label trials in the United States and Europe.

Although a large cohort of genes have been shown to exhibit altered expression in CFS/ME patients, it is currently unknown whether microRNA (miRNA) molecules which regulate gene translation contribute to disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that changes in microRNA expression in patient leukocytes contribute to CFS/ME pathology, and may therefore represent useful diagnostic biomarkers that can be detected in the peripheral blood of CFS/ME patients. METHODS: miRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CFS/ME patients and healthy controls was analysed using the Ambion Bioarray V1. miRNA demonstrating differential expression were validated by qRT-PCR and then replicated in fractionated blood leukocyte subsets from an independent patient cohort. The CFS/ME associated miRNA identified by these experiments were then transfected into primary NK cells and gene expression analyses conducted to identify their gene targets. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified differential expression of 34 miRNA, all of which were up-regulated. Four of the 34 miRNA had confirmed expression changes by qRT-PCR. Fractionating PBMC samples by cell type from an independent patient cohort identified changes in miRNA expression in NK-cells, B-cells and monocytes with the most significant abnormalities occurring in NK cells. Transfecting primary NK cells with hsa-miR-99b or hsa-miR-330-3p, resulted in gene expression changes consistent with NK cell activation but diminished cytotoxicity, suggesting that defective NK cell function contributes to CFS/ME pathology.

As immune signature may be affected by many factors, our objective was to explore the shift in discriminatory cytokines across ME/CFS subjects separated by duration of illness. METHODS: Cytokine expression collected at rest across multiple studies for female ME/CFS subjects (i) 18\u00a0years or younger, ill for 2\u00a0years or less (n\u2009=\u200918), (ii) 18-50 years of age, ill for 7\u00a0years (n\u2009=\u200922), and (iii) age 50\u00a0years or older (n\u2009=\u200928), ill for 11\u00a0years on average. Control subjects were matched for age and body mass index (BMI). Data describing the levels of 16 cytokines using a chemiluminescent assay was used to support the identification of separate linear classification models for each subgroup. In order to isolate the effects of duration of illness alone, cytokines that changed significantly with age in the healthy control subjects were excluded a priori. RESULTS: Optimal selection of cytokines in each group resulted in subsets of IL-1\u03b1, 6, 8, 15 and TNF\u03b1. Common to any 2 of 3 groups were IL-1\u03b1, 6 and 8.

The contribution of IL-1\u03b1, higher in recently ill adolescent ME/CFS subjects was progressively less important with duration. While high levels of IL-8 screened positive for ME/CFS in the recently afflicted, the opposite was true for subjects ill for more than 2\u00a0years. Similarly, while low levels of IL-6 suggested early ME/CFS, the reverse was true in subjects over 18\u00a0years of age ill for more than 2\u00a0years.

MicroRNAs are estimated to target approximately 60% of all human mRNAs and are associated with the regulation of all physiological processes. Similar to many messenger RNAs (mRNA), miRNAs exhibit marked tissue specificity, and appear to be dysregulated in response to specific pathological conditions. Perhaps, one of the most significant findings is that miRNAs are detectable in various biological fluids and are stable during routine clinical processing, paving the way for their use as novel biomarkers. Despite an increasing number of publications reporting individual miRNAs or miRNA signatures to be diagnostic of disease or indicative of response to therapy, there is still a paucity of baseline data necessary for their validation. To this end, we utilised state of the art sequencing technologies to determine the global expression of all circulating miRNAs within the plasma of 18 disease-free human subjects. RESULTS: In excess of 500 miRNAs were detected in our study population with expression levels across several orders of magnitude. Ten highly expressed miRNAs accounted for 90% of the total reads that mapped showing that despite the range of miRNAs present, the total miRNA load of the plasma was predominated by just these few species (50% of which are blood cell associated). Ranges of expression were determined for all miRNA detected (>500) and a set of highly stable miRNAs identified. Finally, the effects of gender, smoking status and body mass index on miRNA expression were determined.

Twenty-one CFS participants completed a 22-\u00a0day open label trial. Faecal microbiota analysis was performed at baseline and at the end of the trial. Participants were administered erythromycin 400\u00a0mg b.d. for 6 days. Actigraphy and questionnaires were used to monitor sleep, symptoms and mood. Changes in patients who showed a clinically significant change in faecal Streptococcus after treatment (responders; defined as post-therapy distribution<6%) were compared to participants who did not respond to treatment. In the seven responders, there was a significant increase in actigraphic total sleep time (p=0.028) from baseline to follow up, compared with non-responders. Improved vigour scores were associated with a lower Streptococcus count (\u03c1=-0.90, p=0.037). For both the responders and the whole group, poorer mood was associated with higher Lactobacillus. Short term antibiotic treatment appears to be insufficient to effect sustainable changes in the gut ecosystem in most CFS participants.

In the current study, we measured the plasma levels of 34 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in 100 chronic ME/CFS patients of long duration and in 79 gender and age-matched controls. We observed highly significant reductions in the concentration of circulating interleukin (IL)-16, IL-7, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF-A) in ME/CFS patients. All three biomarkers were significantly correlated in a multivariate cluster analysis. In addition, we identified significant reductions in the concentrations of fractalkine (CX3CL1) and monokine-induced-by-IFN-\u03b3 (MIG; CXCL9) along with increases in the concentrations of eotaxin 2 (CCL24) in ME/CFS patients. Our data recapitulates previous data from another USA ME/CFS cohort in which circulating levels of IL-7 were reduced. Also, a reduced level of VEGF-A was reported previously in sera of patients with Gulf War Illness as well as in cerebral spinal fluid samples from a different cohort of USA ME/CFS patients. To our knowledge, we are the first to test for levels of IL-16 in ME/CFS patients. In combination with previous data, our work suggests that the clustered reduction of IL-7, IL-16 and VEGF-A may have physiological relevance to ME/CFS disease.

Hurdles to establishing consensus to achieve accurate evaluation of patients with ME continue, fueled by poor agreement about case definitions, slow progress in development of standardized diagnostic approaches, and issues surrounding research priorities. Because there are other medical problems, such as early MS and Parkinson's Disease, which have some similar clinical presentations, it is critical to accurately diagnose ME to make a differential diagnosis. In this article, we explore and summarize advances in the physiological and neurological approaches to understanding, diagnosing, and treating ME. We identify key areas and approaches to elucidate the core and secondary symptom clusters in ME so as to provide some practical suggestions in evaluation of ME for clinicians and researchers. This review, therefore, represents a synthesis of key discussions in the literature, and has important implications for a better understanding of ME, its biological markers, and diagnostic criteria.

        "abstract": "Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from debilitating fatigue which is not alleviated by rest. In addition to the fatigue-related symptoms suffered by patients with CFS/ME and MS, dysfunction of the immune system and, in particular, reduced natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity has also been reported in CFS/ME and MS. The purpose of this pilot study was to compare NK cellular mechanisms in patients with CFS/ME and MS to investigate potential dysfunctions in the NK cell activity pathway. Flow cytometry protocols assessed CD56(dim) CD16(+) and CD56(bright) CD16(+/-) NK cell expression of adhesion molecules, NK activating and inhibiting receptors, NK cell maturation and lytic proteins. All participants in this study were female and included 14 patients with CFS/ME, nine patients with MS and 19 non-fatigued controls. The patient groups and the non-fatigued controls were not taking any immunosuppressive or immune-enhancing medications. In the MS cohort, KIR2DL5 was significantly increased on CD56(bright) CD16(+/-) NK cells and expression of CD94 was significantly increased on CD56(dim) CD16(+) NK cells in comparison with the controls. Co-expression of CD57 and perforin was significantly increased on CD56(dim) CD16(+) NK cells from patients with CFS/ME compared to the MS and non-fatigued control participants. The results from this pilot study suggest that NK cells from patients with CFS/ME and MS may have undergone increased differentiation in response to external stimuli which may affect different mechanisms in the NK cell cytotoxic activity pathway.",

There have been no CFS/ME studies examining innate and adaptive immune cells longitudinally in patients with varying severities. This is the first study to investigate immune cells over 6\u00a0months while also examining CFS/ME patients of varying symptom severity. METHODS: Participants were grouped into 18 healthy controls, 12 moderate and 12 severe CFS/ME patients and flow cytometry was used to examine cell parameters at 0 and 6\u00a0months. RESULTS: Over time, iNKT CD62L expression significantly increased in moderate CFS/ME patients and CD56(bright) NK receptors differed in severe CFS/ME. Na\u00efve CD8(+)T cells, CD8(-)CD4(-) and CD56(-)CD16(-) iNKT phenotypes, \u03b3\u03b42T cells and effector memory subsets were significantly increased in severe CFS/ME patients at 6\u00a0months.

Biomarkers are objective measures that may lead to improvements in our understanding of CFS by providing a more coherent and consistent approach to study, diagnosis and treatment of the illness.

These delineations, in turn, may guide more granular, focused, and targeted treatment strategies based on more precise characterizations of the illness.

        "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) has been classified as a disease of the central nervous system by the WHO since 1969. Many patients carrying this diagnosis do demonstrate an almost bewildering array of biological abnormalities particularly the presence of oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) and a chronically activated innate immune system. The proposal made herein is that once generated chronically activated O&NS and immune-inflammatory pathways conspire to generate a multitude of self-sustaining and self-amplifying pathological processes which are associated with the onset of ME/CFS. Sources of continuous activation of O&NS and immune-inflammatory pathways in ME/CFS are chronic, intermittent and opportunistic infections, bacterial translocation, autoimmune responses, mitochondrial dysfunctions, activation of the Toll-Like Receptor Radical Cycle, and decreased antioxidant levels. Consequences of chronically activated O&NS and immune-inflammatory pathways in ME/CFS are brain disorders, including neuroinflammation and brain hypometabolism / hypoperfusion, toxic effects of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to DNA, secondary autoimmune responses directed against disrupted lipid membrane components and proteins, mitochondrial dysfunctions with a disruption of energy metabolism (e.g. compromised ATP production) and dysfunctional intracellular signaling pathways. The interplay between all of these factors leads to self-amplifying feed forward loops causing a chronic state of activated O&NS, immune-inflammatory and autoimmune pathways which may sustain the disease.",

Non-restorative sleep despite sufficient or extended total sleep time is one of the major clinical diagnostic criteria; however, the underlying cause of this symptom is unknown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature examining sleep in CFS/ME and the issues surrounding the current research findings. Polysomnographic and other objective measures of sleep have observed few differences in sleep parameters between CFS/ME patients and healthy controls, although some discrepancies do exist. This lack of significant objective differences contrasts with the common subjective complaints of disturbed and unrefreshed sleep by CFS/ME patients. The emergence of new, more sensitive techniques that examine the microstructure of sleep are showing promise for detecting differences in sleep between patients and healthy individuals. There is preliminary evidence that alterations in sleep stage transitions and sleep instability, and other physiological mechanisms, such as heart rate variability and altered cortisol profiles, may be evident. Future research investigating the etiology of non-restorative sleep in CFS/ME may also help us to undercover the causes of non-restorative sleep and fatigue in other medical conditions.",

This diagnostic panel identified an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) subset of patients (6), excluding for the first time other similar \"clinical\" conditions such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6), babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, borreliosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and adult rheumatic fever, which may be mistakenly called CFS. CFS patients were treated with valacyclovir (14.3 mg/kg q6h) for \u2265 12 months. Each patient improved, based upon the Functional Activity Appraisal: Energy Index Score Healthcare Worker Assessment (EIPS), which is a validated (FSS-9), item scale with high degree of internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha. METHODS: Antibody to EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM, EBV Diffuse Early Antigen EA(D), and neutralizing antibodies against EBV-encoded DNA polymerase and EBV-encoded dUTPase were assayed serially approximately every three months for 13-16 months from sera obtained from patients with CFS (6) and from sera obtained from twenty patients who had no history of CFS. RESULTS: Antibodies to EBV EA(D) and neutralizing antibodies against the encoded-proteins EBV DNA polymerase and deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) were present in the EBV subset CFS patients. Of the sera samples obtained from patients with CFS 93.9% were positive for EA(D), while 31.6% of the control patients were positive for EBV EA(D). Serum samples were positive for neutralizing antibodies against the EBV-encoded dUTPase (23/52; 44.2%) and DNA polymerase (41/52; 78.8%) in EBV subset CFS patients, but negative in sera of controls. CONCLUSIONS: There is prolonged elevated antibody level against the encoded proteins EBV dUTPase and EBV DNA polymerase in a subset of CFS patients, suggesting that this antibody panel could be used to identify these patients, if these preliminary findings are corroborated by studies with a larger number of EBV subset CFS patients.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue that persists for 6 months or more is termed chronic fatigue. Chronic fatigue (CF) in combination with a minimum of 4 of 8 symptoms and the absence of diseases that could explain these symptoms, constitute the case definition for chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). Inflammation, immune system activation, autonomic dysfunction, impaired functioning in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and neuroendocrine dysregulation have all been suggested as root causes of fatigue. The identification of objective markers consistently associated with CFS/ME is an important goal in relation to diagnosis and treatment, as the current case definitions are based entirely on physical signs and symptoms. This review is focused on the recent literature related to biomarkers for fatigue associated with CFS/ME and, for comparison, those associated with other diseases. These markers are distributed across several of the body's core regulatory systems. A complex construct of symptoms emerges from alterations and/or dysfunctions in the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. We propose that new insight will depend on our ability to develop and deploy an integrative profiling of CFS/ME pathogenesis at the molecular level. Until such a molecular signature is obtained efforts to develop effective treatments will continue to be severely limited.",

Nevertheless, some hypoglycaemic episodes remain unexplained, and inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) should be considered, particularly in cases of multisystemic involvement. In children, IEM are considered a differential diagnosis in cases of hypoglycaemia. In adulthood, IEM-related hypoglycaemia can persist in a previously diagnosed childhood disease. Hypoglycaemia may sometimes be a presenting sign of the IEM. Short stature, hepatomegaly, hypogonadism, dysmorphia or muscular symptoms are signs suggestive of IEM-related hypoglycaemia. In both adults and children, hypoglycaemia can be clinically classified according to its timing. Postprandial hypoglycaemia can be an indicator of either endogenous hyperinsulinism linked to non-insulinoma pancreatogenic hypoglycaemia syndrome (NIPHS, unknown incidence in adults) or very rarely, inherited fructose intolerance. Glucokinase-activating mutations (one family) are the only genetic disorder responsible for NIPH in adults that has been clearly identified so far. Exercise-induced hyperinsulinism is linked to an activating mutation of the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (one family). Fasting hypoglycaemia may be caused by IEM that were already diagnosed in childhood and persist into adulthood: glycogen storage disease (GSD) type I, III, 0, VI and IX; glucose transporter 2 deficiency; fatty acid oxidation; ketogenesis disorders; and gluconeogenesis disorders. Fasting hypoglycaemia in adulthood can also be a rare presenting sign of an IEM, especially in GSD type III, fatty acid oxidation [medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), ketogenesis disorders (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase deficiency, and gluconeogenesis disorders (fructose-1,6-biphosphatase deficiency)].",

Presently, it is unknown whether these immunological changes remain consistent over time. This study investigates Natural Killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity, NK cell subsets (CD56brightCD16- and CD56dimCD16+) and cytokines, over the course of a12 month period in patients with CFS/ME. METHODS: The participants in the study comprised 65 (47.2 \u00b1 11.5 years) CFS/ME participants and 21 (45.2 \u00b1 9.3 years) non-fatigued controls. Flow cytometry protocols were used to assess NK subsets and NK cytotoxic activity at various time points that included baseline (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3). Cytokine secretions were measured following mitogenic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: NK cytotoxic activity was significantly decreased in the CFS/ME patients at T1, T2 and T3 compared to the non-fatigued group. Additionally, in comparison to the non-fatigued controls, the CFS/ME group had significantly lower numbers of CD56brightCD16- NK cells at both T1 and T2. Interestingly, following mitogenic stimulation, cytokine secretion revealed significant increases in IL-10, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 at T1 in the CFS/ME group. A significant decrease was observed at T2 in the CFS/ME group for IL-10 and IL-17A while at T3, IL-2 was increased in the CFS/ME group in comparison to the non-fatigued controls. Overall cytotoxic activity was significantly decreased at T3 compared to T1 and T2. CD56brightCD16- NK cells were much lower at T2 compared to T1 and T3. IL-10 and IL-17A secretion was elevated at T2 in comparison to T1 and T3. CONCLUSION: These results confirm decreases in immune function in CFS/ME patients, suggesting an increased susceptibility to viral and other infections.

METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Pooled cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from nPTLS patients, CFS patients, and healthy volunteers were comprehensively analyzed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS), coupled with immunoaffinity depletion methods to reduce protein-masking by abundant proteins. Individual patient and healthy control CSF samples were analyzed directly employing a MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics approach. We found that both groups, and individuals within the groups, could be distinguished from each other and normals based on their specific CSF proteins (p<0.01). CFS (n\u200a=\u200a43) had 2,783 non-redundant proteins, nPTLS (n\u200a=\u200a25) contained 2,768 proteins, and healthy normals had 2,630 proteins. Preliminary pathway analysis demonstrated that the data could be useful for hypothesis generation on the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying these two related syndromes.

This study focused on the stress mediator neuropeptide Y (NPY). We hypothesized that NPY would be a useful biomarker for CFS. METHODS: The CFS patients (n = 93) were from the Chronic Fatigue and Related Disorders Clinic at the University of Miami and met the 1994 case definition of Fukuda and colleagues. Healthy sedentary controls (n = 100)) were from NIH or VA funded studies. Another fatiguing, multi-symptom illness, Gulf War Illness (GWI), was also compared to CFS. We measured NPY in plasma using a radioimmunoassay (RIA). Psychometric measures, available for a subset of CFS patients included: Perceived Stress Scale, Profile of Mood States, ATQ Positive & Negative Self-Talk Scores, the COPE, the Beck Depression Inventory, Fatigue Symptom Inventory, Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination, Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36, and the Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS: Plasma NPY was elevated in CFS subjects, compared to controls (p = .000) and to GWI cases (p = .000). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analyses indicated that the predictive ability of plasma NPY to distinguish CFS patients from healthy controls and from GWI was significantly better than chance alone. In 42 patients with CFS, plasma NPY had significant correlations (<0.05) with perceived stress, depression, anger/hostility, confusion, negative thoughts, positive thoughts, general health, and cognitive status. In each case the correlation (+ or -) was in the anticipated direction. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first in the CFS literature to report that plasma NPY is elevated compared to healthy controls and to a fatigued comparison group, GWI patients. The significant correlations of NPY with stress, negative mood, general health, depression and cognitive function strongly suggest that this peptide be considered as a biomarker to distinguish subsets of CFS.",

To further pursue our encephalopathy hypothesis, we did spinal taps on 31 women and 13 men fulfilling the 1994 case definition for CFS and on 8 women and 5 men serving as healthy controls. Our outcome measures were white blood cell count, protein concentration in spinal fluid, and cytokines detectable in spinal fluid. We found that significantly more CFS patients had elevations in either protein levels or number of cells than healthy controls (30 versus 0%), and 13 CFS patients had protein levels and cell numbers that were higher than laboratory norms; patients with abnormal fluid had a lower rate of having comorbid depression than those with normal fluid.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a core diagnostic criterion in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The majority of ME/CFS patients have no evidence of hypotension or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) during head-up tilt, but do show a significantly larger reduction in stroke volume index (SVI) when upright compared to controls. Theoretically a reduction in SVI should be accompanied by a compensatory increase in heart rate (HR). When there is an incomplete compensatory increase in HR, this is considered chronotropic incompetence. This study explored the relationship between HR and SVI to determine whether chronotropic incompetence was present during tilt testing in ME/CFS patients. METHODS: From a database of individuals who had undergone tilt testing with Doppler measurements for SVI both supine and end-tilt, we selected ME/CFS patients and healthy controls (HC) who had no evidence of POTS or hypotension during the test. To determine the relation between the HR increase and SVI decrease during the tilt test in patients, we calculated the 95% prediction intervals of this relation in HC. Chronotropic incompetence in patients was defined as a HR increase below the lower limit of the 95th % prediction interval of the HR increase in HC. RESULTS: We compared 362 ME/CFS patients with 52 HC. At end-tilt, tilt lasting for 15 (4) min, ME/CFS patients had a significantly lower SVI (22 (4) vs. 27 (4) ml/m2; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and a higher HR (87 (11) vs. 78 (15) bpm; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) compared to HC. There was a similar relationship between HR and SVI between ME/CFS patients and HC in the supine position. During tilt ME/CFS patients had a lower HR for a given SVI; 37% had an inadequate HR increase. Chronotropic incompetence was more common in more severely affected ME/CFS patients. CONCLUSION: These novel findings represent the first description of orthostatic chronotropic incompetence during tilt testing in ME/CFS patients.",

        "abstract": "Whilst most patients infected with COVID-19 make a full recovery, around 1 in 33 patients in the UK report ongoing symptoms post-infection, termed 'long COVID'. Studies have demonstrated that infection with early COVID-19 variants increases postoperative mortality and pulmonary complications for around 7\u00a0weeks after acute infection. Furthermore, this increased risk persists for those with ongoing symptoms beyond 7\u00a0weeks. Patients with long COVID may therefore also be at increased postoperative risk, and despite the significant prevalence of long COVID, there are minimal guidelines on how best to assess and manage these patients perioperatively. Long COVID shares several clinical and pathophysiological similarities with conditions such as myalgic encephalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural tachycardia syndrome; however, there are no current guidelines for the preoperative management of these patients to help develop something similar for long COVID patients. Developing guidelines for long COVID patients is further complicated by its heterogenous presentation and pathology. These patients can have persistent abnormalities on pulmonary function tests and echocardiography 3\u00a0months after acute infection, correlating with a reduced functional capacity. Conversely, some long COVID patients can continue to experience symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue despite normal pulmonary function tests and echocardiography, yet demonstrating significantly reduced aerobic capacity on cardiopulmonary exercise testing even a year after initial infection. How to comprehensively risk assess these patients is therefore challenging. Existing preoperative guidelines for elective patients with recent COVID-19 generally focus on the timing of surgery and recommendations for pre-assessment if surgery is required before this time interval has elapsed. How long to delay surgery in those with ongoing symptoms and how to manage them perioperatively are less clear. We suggest that multidisciplinary decision-making is required for these patients, using a systems-based approach to guide discussion with specialists and the need for further preoperative investigations. However, without a better understanding of the postoperative risks for long COVID patients, it is difficult to obtain a multidisciplinary consensus and obtain informed patient consent. Prospective studies of long COVID patients undergoing elective surgery are urgently required to help quantify their postoperative risk and develop comprehensive perioperative guidelines for this complex patient group.",

Suspected long-term cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection might present as a constellation of symptoms that can be challenging for clinicians to diagnose and treat. When assessing patients with these symptoms, clinicians need to keep in mind myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, postexertional malaise and postexertional symptom exacerbation, dysautonomia with cardiac manifestations such as inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and occasionally mast cell activation syndrome. In this review we summarize the globally evolving evidence around management of cardiac sequelae of long COVID. In addition, we include a Canadian perspective, consisting of a panel of expert opinions from people with lived experience and experienced clinicians across Canada who have been involved in management of long COVID.

The symptomatology is partly similar to that reported by people with chronic fatigue syndrome and other unwell studied long-lasting diseases that may occur after other infections. People who have experienced more severe COVID-19 illness are at higher risk of developing long COVID, although anyone who was infected can experience post-COVID conditions. Importantly, unvaccinated individuals are more likely to develop long COVID.

The TRYCAT pathway has not been studied extensively in association with the physiosomatic and affective symptoms of Long COVID. In the present study, we measured serum TRY, TRYCATs, insulin resistance (using the Homeostatic Model Assessment Index 2-insulin resistance, HOMA2-IR), C-reactive protein (CRP), physiosomatic, depression, and anxiety symptoms in 90 Long COVID patients, 3-10 months after remission of acute infection. We were able to construct an endophenotypic class of severe Long COVID (22% of the patients) with very low TRY and oxygen saturation (SpO2, during acute infection), increased kynurenine, KYN/TRY ratio, CRP, and very high ratings on all symptom domains. One factor could be extracted from physiosomatic symptoms (including chronic fatigue-fibromyalgia), depression, and anxiety symptoms, indicating that all domains are manifestations of the common physio-affective phenome. Three Long COVID biomarkers (CRP, KYN/TRY, and IR) explained around 40% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome. The latter and the KYN/TRY ratio were significantly predicted by peak body temperature (PBT) and lowered SpO2 during acute infection. One validated latent vector could be extracted from the three symptom domains and a composite based on CRP, KYN/TRY, and IR (Long COVID), and PBT and SpO2 (acute COVID-19). In conclusion, the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID is a manifestation of inflammatory responses during acute and Long COVID, and lowered plasma tryptophan and increased kynurenine may contribute to these effects.",

We conduct a review of the literature documenting the female reproductive health impacts of Long COVID which may include disruptions to the menstrual cycle, gonadal function, ovarian sufficiency, menopause, and fertility, as well as symptom exacerbation around menstruation. Given limited research, we also review the reproductive health impacts of overlapping and associated illnesses including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), connective tissue disorders like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), and endometriosis, as these illnesses may help to elucidate reproductive health conditions in Long COVID.

Additionally, in Long COVID and associated illnesses, symptoms can be impacted by the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause. We propose priorities for future research and reproductive healthcare in Long COVID based on a review of the literature. These include screening Long COVID patients for comorbid and associated conditions; studying the impacts of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and menopause on symptoms and illness progression; uncovering the role of sex differences and sex hormones in Long COVID and associated illnesses; and addressing historical research and healthcare inequities that have contributed to detrimental knowledge gaps for this patient population.",

The present lack of effective treatments makes managing long COVID a major challenge. One of the underlying mechanisms of long COVID may be mitochondrial dysfunction. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections can alter the mitochondria responsible for energy production in cells. This alteration leads to mitochondrial dysfunction which, in turn, increases oxidative stress. Ultimately, this results in a loss of mitochondrial integrity and cell death. Moreover, viral proteins can bind to mitochondrial complexes, disrupting mitochondrial function and causing the immune cells to over-react. This over-reaction leads to inflammation and potentially long COVID symptoms. It is important to note that the roles of mitochondrial damage and inflammatory responses caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the development of long COVID are still being elucidated. Targeting mitochondrial function may provide promising new clinical approaches for long-COVID patients; however, further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of such approaches.",

Observational studies indicate that up to 30%-40% of convalescent COVID-19 patients develop chronic widespread pain and fatigue and fulfill the 2016 diagnostic criteria for \"fibromyalgia.\" A recent study suggested a theoretical neuro-biomechanical model (coined \"Fascial Armoring\") to help explain the pathogenesis and cellular pathway of fibromyalgia, pointing toward mechanical abnormalities in connective tissue and fascia, driven by contractile myo/fibroblasts and altered extracellular matrix remodeling with downstream corresponding neurophysiological aberrations. This may help explain several of fibromyalgia's manifestations such as pain, distribution of pain, trigger points/tender spots, hyperalgesia, chronic fatigue, cardiovascular abnormalities, metabolic abnormalities, autonomic abnormalities, small fiber neuropathy, various psychosomatic symptoms, lack of obvious inflammation, and silent imaging investigations. Pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways provide input into this mechanism via stimulation of proto/myofibroblasts. In this hypothesis and theory paper the theoretical model of Fascial Armoring is presented to help explain the pathogenesis and manifestations of \"long COVID-19\" as a disease of immuno-rheumo-psycho-neurology.

Here, we propose a description of the pathophysiology of the Long COVID presentation based on inflammatory cytokine cascades and the p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways that regulate cytokine production. In this model, the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is hypothesized to trigger a dysregulated peripheral immune system activation with subsequent cytokine release. Chronic low-grade inflammation leads to dysregulated brain microglia with an exaggerated release of central cytokines, producing neuroinflammation. Immunothrombosis linked to chronic inflammation with microclot formation leads to decreased tissue perfusion and ischemia. Intermittent fatigue, Post Exertional Malaise (PEM), CNS symptoms with \"brain fog,\" arthralgias, paresthesias, dysautonomia, and GI and ophthalmic problems can consequently arise as result of the elevated peripheral and central cytokines. There are abundant similarities between symptoms in Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). DNA polymorphisms and viral-induced epigenetic changes to cytokine gene expression may lead to chronic inflammation in Long COVID patients, predisposing some to develop autoimmunity, which may be the gateway to ME/CFS.",

The susceptibility factors discussed here are both genetic and environmental although not well understood. While the dysfunctional physiology in ME/CFS is becoming clearer, understanding has been hampered by different combinations of symptoms in each affected person. A common core set of mainly neurological symptoms forms the modern clinical case definition, in the absence of an accessible molecular diagnostic test. This landscape has prompted interest in whether ME/CFS patients can be classified into a particular phenotype/subtype that might assist better management of their illness and suggest preferred therapeutic options. Currently, the same promising drugs, nutraceuticals, or behavioral therapies available can be beneficial, have no effect, or be detrimental to each individual patient. We have shown that individuals with the same disease profile exhibit unique molecular changes and physiological responses to stress, exercise and even vaccination. Key features of ME/CFS discussed here are the possible mechanisms determining the shift of an immune/inflammatory response from transient to chronic in ME/CFS, and how the brain and CNS manifests the neurological symptoms, likely with activation of its specific immune system and resulting neuroinflammation.

It was hypothesized that a proportion of people with long COVID might be experiencing functional symptoms. METHODS: A systematic review of studies containing original data on long COVID was performed. The frequency and characteristics of neurological symptoms were reviewed, looking for positive evidence suggesting an underlying functional disorder and the hypothesized causes of long COVID. RESULTS: In all, 102 studies were included in our narrative synthesis. The most consistently reported neurological symptoms were cognitive difficulties, headaches, pain, dizziness, fatigue, sleep-related symptoms and ageusia/anosmia. Overall, no evidence was found that any authors had systematically looked for positive features of FND. An exception was three studies describing temporal inconsistency. In general, the neurological symptoms were insufficiently characterized to support or refute a diagnosis of FND. Moreover, only 13 studies specifically focused on long COVID after mild infection, where the impact of confounders from the general effects of severe illness would be mitigated. Only one study hypothesized that some people with long COVID might have a functional disorder, and another eight studies a chronic-fatigue-syndrome-like response. DISCUSSION: Neurological symptoms are prevalent in long COVID, but poorly characterized. The similarities between some manifestations of long COVID and functional disorders triggered by acute illnesses are striking. Unfortunately, the current literature is plagued by confounders, including the mixing of patients with initial mild infection with those with severe acute medical complications. The hypothesis that long COVID might in part correspond to a functional disorder remains untested.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of Long COVID, clinically known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), may mitigate progression to chronic diseases such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Our objective was to determine the utility of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) to assess the frequency and severity of common symptoms of ME/CFS, to diagnose and monitor symptoms in patients with PASC. METHODS: This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled 185 people that included 34 patients with PASC that had positive COVID-19 test and persistent symptoms of >3 months and 151 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS. PASC patients were followed over 1 year and responded to the DSQ at baseline and 12 months. ME/CFS patients responded to the DSQ at baseline and 1 year later. Changes in symptoms over time were analyzed using a fixed-effects model to compute difference-in-differences estimates between baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were defined as having PASC if they had a previous positive COVID-19 test, were experiencing symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise, or other unwellness for at least 3 months, were not hospitalized for COVID-19, had no documented major medical or psychiatric diseases prior to COVID-19, and had no other active and untreated disease processes that could explain their symptoms. PASC patients were recruited in 2021. ME/CFS patients were recruited in 2017. RESULTS: At baseline, patients with PASC had similar symptom severity and frequency as patients with ME/CFS and satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. ME/CFS patients experienced significantly more severe unrefreshing sleep and flu-like symptoms. Five symptoms improved significantly over the course of 1 year for PASC patients including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, irritable bowel symptoms and feeling unsteady. In contrast, there were no significant symptom improvements for ME/CFS patients. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: There were considerable similarities between patients with PASC and ME/CFS at baseline. However, symptoms improved for PASC patients over the course of a year but not for ME/CFS patients. PASC patients with significant symptom improvement no longer met ME/CFS clinical diagnostic criteria. These findings indicate that the DSQ can be used to reliably assess and monitor PASC symptoms.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID) is associated with physio-somatic (chronic fatigue syndrome and somatic symptoms) and affective (depression and anxiety) symptoms. The severity of the long COVID physio-affective phenome is largely predicted by increased peak body temperature (BT) and lowered oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the acute infectious phase. This study aims to delineate whether the association of BT and SpO2 during the acute phase and the long COVID physio-affective phenome is mediated by neurotoxicity (NT) resulting from activated immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. METHODS: We recruited 86 patients with long COVID (3-4 months after the acute phase) and 39 healthy controls and assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), caspase 1, interleukin (IL) 1\u03b2, IL-18, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and calcium (Ca), as well as peak BT and SpO2 during the acute phase. RESULTS: Cluster analysis revealed that a significant part (34.9%) of long COVID patients (n = 30) show a highly elevated NT index as computed based on IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, caspase 1, CRP, MPO, and AOPPs. Partial least squares analysis showed that 61.6% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of long COVID could be explained by the NT index, lowered Ca, and peak BT/SpO2 in the acute phase and prior vaccinations with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. The most important predictors of the physio-affective phenome are Ca, CRP, IL-1\u03b2, AOPPs, and MPO. CONCLUSION: The infection-immune-inflammatory core of acute COVID-19 strongly predicts the development of physio-affective symptoms 3-4 months later, and these effects are partly mediated by neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways.",

More than 200 symptoms have been identified with impacts on multiple organ systems. At least 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have long COVID, with cases increasing daily. Biomedical research has made substantial progress in identifying various pathophysiological changes and risk factors and in characterizing the illness; further, similarities with other viral-onset illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have laid the groundwork for research in the field. In this Review, we explore the current literature and highlight key findings, the overlap with other conditions, the variable onset of symptoms, long COVID in children and the impact of vaccinations. Although these key findings are critical to understanding long COVID, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient, and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses.

The emerging condition of long COVID, its epidemiology, pathophysiological impacts on patients of different backgrounds, physiological mechanisms emerging as explanations of the condition, and treatment strategies being trialled. The review leads from a Physiological Society online conference on this topic. What advances does it highlight? Progress in understanding the pathophysiology and cellular mechanisms underlying Long COVID and potential therapeutic and management strategies. ABSTRACT: Long COVID, the prolonged illness and fatigue suffered by a small proportion of those infected with SARS-CoV-2, is placing an increasing burden on individuals and society. A Physiological Society virtual meeting in February 2022 brought clinicians and researchers together to discuss the current understanding of long COVID mechanisms, risk factors and recovery. This review highlights the themes arising from that meeting. It considers the nature of long COVID, exploring its links with other post-viral illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and highlights how long COVID research can help us better support those suffering from all post-viral syndromes. Long COVID research started particularly swiftly in populations routinely monitoring their physical performance - namely the military and elite athletes. The review highlights how the high degree of diagnosis, intervention and monitoring of success in these active populations can suggest management strategies for the wider population. We then consider how a key component of performance monitoring in active populations, cardiopulmonary exercise training, has revealed long COVID-related changes in physiology - including alterations in peripheral muscle function, ventilatory inefficiency and autonomic dysfunction. The nature and impact of dysautonomia are further discussed in relation to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, fatigue and treatment strategies that aim to combat sympathetic overactivation by stimulating the vagus nerve. We then interrogate the mechanisms that underlie long COVID symptoms, with a focus on impaired oxygen delivery due to micro-clotting and disruption of cellular energy metabolism, before considering treatment strategies that indirectly or directly tackle these mechanisms. These include remote inspiratory muscle training and integrated care pathways that combine rehabilitation and drug interventions with research into long COVID healthcare access across different populations. Overall, this review showcases how physiological research reveals the changes that occur in long COVID and how different therapeutic strategies are being developed and tested to combat this condition.",

One possible approach involves alternative medical interventions, which have been widely used to treat and manage symptoms of a variety of medical problems including post-viral infections. Meditation has been found to reduce fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, and for those with post-viral infections, it has enhanced immunity, and reduced inflammatory-driven pathogenesis. Our article summarizes the literature on what is known about mindfulness meditation interventions, and reviews evidence on how it may apply to those with Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).

        "abstract": "As of this writing, it is estimated that there have been nearly 600 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) around the world with over six million deaths. While shocking, these figures do not fully illustrate the morbidity associated with this disease. It is also estimated that between 10% and 30% of those who survive COVID-19 develop persistent symptoms after the acute infection has passed. These individuals, who most often experienced initial infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) considered mild to moderate in severity, often display a broad array of symptoms. Collectively, this disorder or syndrome is now referred to as Long COVID (among other designations), and it represents a national/international health crisis. The most frequently reported symptoms associated with Long COVID include chronic fatigue with post exertional features, neurocognitive dysfunction, breathlessness, and somatic pain. Long COVID can range in severity from mild to severely debilitating, with resultant loss of quality of life and productivity. For now, there are many unanswered questions surrounding Long COVID: how can it be best defined, what is needed for accurate diagnosis, what is causing it, and how should it be best managed. How rheumatologists will engage in the Long COVID pandemic is another question; at the minimum, we will be called upon to evaluate and manage our own patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who have developed it. This review focuses on addressing the disease essentials, providing both declarative and procedural knowledge to prepare rheumatologists for how to address Long COVID: understanding its origins, its current case definitions, epidemiology, pathobiology and clinical manifestations. Finally, it will provide an outline on how to clinically approach patients with possible Long COVID and initiate treatment and/or guide them on how to best manage it.",

Despite an increasing body of literature, long COVID remains poorly characterized. We retrospectively analysed data from electronic medical records of patients admitted to the post-COVID-19 outpatient service of the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy, between June 2020 and June 2021, 4-12 weeks after hospital discharge. A total of 428 patients, 41% women, median age 64 years, underwent a follow-up visit a median 53 days after hospital discharge.

Common symptoms are fatigue, postexertional malaise and cognitive dysfunction. There is currently no effective treatment and the underlying mechanisms are unknown, although several hypotheses exist, with chronic inflammation as a common denominator. In prospective studies, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested to be effective for the treatment of similar syndromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. A case series has suggested positive effects of HBOT in long COVID-19. This randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial will explore HBOT as a potential treatment for long COVID-19. The primary objective is to evaluate if HBOT improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients with long COVID-19 compared with placebo/sham. The main secondary objective is to evaluate whether HBOT improves endothelial function, objective physical performance and short-term HRQoL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase II clinical trial in 80 previously healthy subjects debilitated due to long COVID-19, with low HRQoL. Clinical data, HRQoL questionnaires, blood samples, objective tests and activity metre data will be collected at baseline. Subjects will be randomised to a maximum of 10 treatments with hyperbaric oxygen or sham treatment over 6\u2009weeks. Assessments for safety and efficacy will be performed at 6, 13, 26 and 52 weeks, with the primary endpoint (physical domains in RAND 36-Item Health Survey) and main secondary endpoints defined at 13 weeks after baseline. Data will be reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The trial is approved by the Swedish National Institutional Review Board (2021-02634) and the Swedish Medical Products Agency (5.1-2020-36673).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome is a persistent and debilitating disorder. According to several studies, chronic fatigue syndrome has been identified among recovered COVID-19 patients as the most common symptom of long COVID. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to obtain the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome in long COVID cases. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analysed reported results of studies that assessed the occurrence of chronic fatigue syndrome among COVID-19 patients four weeks after the onset of symptoms. The study selection was commenced by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, Embase, and Google scholar using the keywords of Chronic fatigue syndrome, COVID-19, and post-COVID-19 syndrome. The searches were without a lower time limit and until April 2022. Heterogeneity of studies was assessed using the I2 index, and a random effects model was used for analysis. Data analysis was performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (version 2). RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome four weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, in 52 studies with a sample size of 127,117, was 45.2% (95% CI: 34.1-56.9%). Meta-regression analysis in examining the effects of the two factors of sample size, and year of study on the changes in the overall prevalence, showed that with increasing sample size, and year of study, the prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome among long COVID patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05). CONCLUSION: Our results show that the overall prevalence of chronic fatigue syndrome as a long COVID symptom is 45.2%. Chronic fatigue after infection with COVID-19 can negatively affect personal and social lives.

The clinical suspicion and diagnosis of PCC can be challenging due to the non-specific nature of signs and symptoms. In many patients, infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could lead to long-term symptoms including fatigue, headaches, and cognitive dysfunction. Here, we present the case of a patient incidentally diagnosed with an adrenal mass that proved to be a PCC after imaging was performed due to persisting complaints after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. A 37-year-old male patient was referred to our center because of a right-sided inhomogeneous adrenal mass, incidentally found during a computed tomographic scan of the thorax performed due to cough and dyspnea that persisted after COVID-19 infection. Other complaints that were present prior to COVID-19 infection included profuse sweating, dizziness, exhaustion with chronic fatigue, and concentration difficulties. The patient had no history of hypertension, his blood pressure was normal, and the 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed normotension but with the absence of nocturnal dipping. Plasma normetanephrine was 5.7-fold above the upper limit (UL) of reference intervals (738 pg/ml, UL = 129 pg/ml), whereas plasma metanephrine and methoxytyramine were normal at 30 pg/ml (UL = 84 pg/ml) and <4 pg/ml (UL = 16 pg/ml), respectively. Preoperative preparation with phenoxybenzamine was initiated, and a 4-cm tumor was surgically resected. Profuse sweating as well as dizziness was resolved after adrenalectomy pointing toward PCC and not COVID-19-associated patient concerns. Altogether, this case illustrates the difficulties in recognizing the possibility of PCC due to the non-specific nature of signs and symptoms of the tumor, which in this case did not include hypertension and coincided with some of the symptoms of long COVID-19.",

Although many people recover from COVID-19 infection, they are likely to develop persistent symptoms similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) after discharge. Those constellations of symptoms persist for months after infection, called Long COVID, which may lead to considerable financial burden and healthcare challenges. However, the mechanisms underlying Long COVID and ME/CFS remain unclear. METHODS: We collected the genes associated with Long COVID and ME/CFS in databases by restricted screening conditions and clinical sample datasets with limited filters. The common genes for Long COVID and ME/CFS were finally obtained by taking the intersection. We performed several advanced bioinformatics analyses based on common genes, including gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, transcription factor (TF)-gene interaction network analysis, transcription factor-miRNA co-regulatory network analysis, and candidate drug analysis prediction. RESULTS: We found nine common genes between Long COVID and ME/CFS and gained a piece of detailed information on their biological functions and signaling pathways through enrichment analysis. Five hub proteins (IL-6, IL-1B, CD8A, TP53, and CXCL8) were collected by the PPI network. The TF-gene and TF-miRNA coregulatory networks were demonstrated by NetworkAnalyst. In the end, 10 potential chemical compounds were predicted. CONCLUSION: This study revealed common gene interaction networks of Long COVID and ME/CFS and predicted potential therapeutic drugs for clinical practice.

In an as yet unpublished analysis from Yale University low plasma cortisol levels discriminated Long COVID from asymptomatic convalescent or healthy non-infected controls. Although various immune perturbations were present in Long COVID, low levels of cortisol were prominent and strikingly, depression and anxiety were increased. It has become clear that Long COVID features may be similar to those described in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, post-SARS sickness syndrome, and various chronic stress syndromes which have been linked to hypocortisolemia. Notably, lack of response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to hypocortisolemia shows a suppressed axis in Long COVID. We suggest that the inability of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to recover after the acute illness, perhaps due to protracted stress in predisposed individuals, may represent the pathogenetic basis of the Long COVID-associated clinical and immunological manifestations.",

The exact pathophysiology of the affective, chronic fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms (labelled as \"physio-affective phenome\") of LC has remained elusive. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to delineate the effects of oxygen saturation (SpO2) and body temperature during the acute phase on the physio-affective phenome of LC. METHOD: We recruited 120 LC patients and 36 controls. For all participants, we assessed the lowest SpO2 and peak body temperature during acute COVID-19, and the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMD/HAMA) and Fibro Fatigue (FF) scales 3-4 months later. RESULTS: Lowered SpO2 and increased body temperature during the acute phase and female sex predict 60.7% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of LC. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we were able to delineate a new endophenotype class, which comprises around 26.7% of the LC patients and is characterised by very low SpO2 and very high body temperature, and depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and autonomic and gastro-intestinal symptoms scores. Single latent vectors could be extracted from both biomarkers, depression, anxiety and FF symptoms or from both biomarkers, insomnia, chronic fatigue, gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. CONCLUSION: The newly constructed endophenotype class and pathway phenotypes indicate that the physio-affective phenome of LC is at least in part the consequence of the pathophysiology of acute COVID-19, namely the combined effects of lowered SpO2, increased body temperature and the associated immune-inflammatory processes and lung lesions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also now known as long COVID, has become a major global health and economic burden. Previously, we provided evidence that there is a significant insoluble fibrin amyloid microclot load in the circulation of individuals with long COVID, and that these microclots entrap a substantial number of inflammatory molecules, including those that might prevent clot breakdown. Scientifically, the most challenging aspect of this debilitating condition is that traditional pathology tests such as a serum CRP (C-reactive protein) may not show any significant abnormal inflammatory markers, albeit these tests measure only the soluble inflammatory molecules. Elevated, or abnormal soluble biomarkers such as IL-6, D-Dimer or fibrinogen indicate an increased risk for thrombosis or a host immune response in COVID-19. The absence of biomarkers in standard pathology tests, result in a significant amount of confusion for patients and clinicians, as patients are extremely sick or even bed-ridden but with no regular identifiable reason for their disease. Biomarkers that are currently available cannot detect the molecules present in the microclots we identified and are therefore unable to confirm their presence or the mechanisms that drive their formation. METHODS: Here we analysed the protein content of double-digested microclots of 99 long COVID patients and 29 healthy controls. The patients suffering from long COVID reported their symptoms through a questionnaire completed by themselves or their attending physician. RESULTS: Our long COVID cohort's symptoms were found to be in line with global findings, where the most prevalent symptoms were constant fatigue (74%,) cognitive impairment (71%) and depression and anxiety (30%). Our most noteworthy findings were a reduced level of plasma\u00a0Kallikrein compared to our controls, an increased level of platelet factor 4 (PF4) von Willebrand factor (VWF), and a marginally increased level of \u03b1-2 antiplasmin (\u03b1-2-AP). We also found a significant presence of antibodies entrapped inside these microclots. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the presence of pro-inflammatory molecules that may also contribute to a failed fibrinolysis phenomenon, which could possibly explain why individuals with long COVID suffer from chronic fatigue, dyspnoea, or cognitive impairment. In addition, significant platelet hyperactivation was noted. Hyperactivation will result in the granular content of platelets being shed into the circulation, including PF4. Overall, our results provide further evidence of both a failed fibrinolytic system in long COVID/PASC and the entrapment of many proteins whose presence might otherwise go unrecorded. These findings might have significant implications for individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",

Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current body of evidence that deals with the relationship of COVID-19 infection with the long COVID syndrome to define the possible immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of long COVID and to describe potential strategies for the diagnosis and clinical management of the condition. Methods: Extensive research was conducted in medical literature data bases by applying terms such as long COVID, post-COVID-19 condition, pathogenesis of long COVID, management of the long COVID syndrome. Results: The post-COVID conditions, a more recent and less anxiety-inducing term for the patient than long COVID or \"long haul,\" is an umbrella term for a wide range of physical and mental health symptoms similar to those seen in patients with the myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), experienced by some patients and are present \u2265 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the precise reason why long COVID develops is unknown, one of the major causes is thought to be related to chronic inflammation with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines responsible for the symptoms of the disorder. Conclusion: Long COVID is a growing burden for millions of patients, health-care providers, and global health-care systems, and is a particular challenge for the allergist/immunologist. Many survivors of COVID-19 struggle with multiple symptoms, increased disability, reduced function, and poor quality of life. The allergist/immunologist can assist the total health-care team's efforts in providing a comprehensive and coordinated approach to the management of these patients by promoting comprehensive vaccination and rehabilitation and social services that focus on improving physical, mental, and social well-being, and by establishing partnerships with specialists and other health-care professionals who can provide behavioral, lifestyle, and integrative approaches that may have much to offer in helping patients cope with their symptoms.",

The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.",

AIM/METHODS: This article summarizes the current literature on pulmonary manifestations with a\u00a0focus on expert opinions and recommendations. RESULTS: After chronic fatigue, dyspnea is the most common symptom in patients with long COVID syndrome. Pathological findings are mainly found after a\u00a0severe acute course of COVID-19 and include radiological changes with characteristics of interstitial lung diseases, restrictive ventilation patterns and limitations in diffusion capacity as the most common pathological finding. Although both symptoms and pathological pulmonary alterations improve over time, some patients may still suffer from abnormalities months after the acute infection.

There have been few studies on patients with long COVID in whom ME/CFS was diagnosed by physicians based on standardized criteria after examinations and exclusion diagnosis and not based on only subjective symptoms. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the detailed characteristics of ME/CFS in patients with long COVID. Materials and Methods: A retrospective descriptive study was performed for patients who visited a COVID-19 aftercare clinic established in Okayama University Hospital during the period was from February 2021 to April 2022. Results: Clinical data were obtained from medical records for 281 patients, and 279 patients who met the definition of long COVID were included. The overall prevalence rate of ME/CFS diagnosed by three sets of ME/CFS criteria (Fukuda, Canadian and IOM criteria) was 16.8% (48.9% in male and 51.1% in females). The most frequent symptoms in ME/CFS patients were general fatigue and post-exertional malaise (89.4% of the patients), headache (34.0%), insomnia (23.4%), dysosmia (21.3%) and dysgeusia (19.1%). Dizziness, chest pain, insomnia and headache were characteristic symptoms related to ME/CFS. The male to female ratio in ME/CFS patients was equal in the present study, although ME/CFS was generally more common in women in previous studies. Given that patients with ME/CFS had more severe conditions in the acute phase of COVID-19, the severity of the acute infectious state might be involved in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.

This scientific document aims to provide insight into the possible causes and therapeutic options available for the cardiovascular manifestations of long COVID. In addition to chronic fatigue, which is a common symptom of long COVID, patients may present with chest pain, ECG abnormalities, postural orthostatic tachycardia, or newly developed supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Imaging of the heart and vessels has provided evidence of chronic, post-infectious perimyocarditis with consequent left or right ventricular failure, arterial wall inflammation, or microthrombosis in certain patient populations. Better understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID will aid in the development of effective treatment strategies for its cardiovascular manifestations. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including those involving direct effects on the myocardium, microthrombotic damage to vessels or endothelium, or persistent inflammation. Unfortunately, existing circulating biomarkers, coagulation, and inflammatory markers, are not highly predictive for either the presence or outcome of long COVID when measured 3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some patients with acute COVID-19 are left with persistent, debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairment (\"brain fog\"), orthostatic intolerance (OI) and other symptoms (\"Long COVID\"). Many of the symptoms are like those of other post-infectious fatigue syndromes and may meet criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Common diagnostic laboratory tests are often unrevealing. METHODS: We evaluated whether a simple, standardized, office-based test of OI, the 10-min NASA Lean Test (NLT), would aggravate symptoms and produce objective hemodynamic and cognitive abnormalities, the latter being evaluated by a simple smart phone-based app. PARTICIPANTS: People with Long COVID (N = 42), ME/CFS (N = 26) and healthy control subjects (N = 20) were studied just before, during, immediately after, 2 and 7 days following completion of the NLT. RESULTS: The NLT provoked a worsening of symptoms in the two patient groups but not in healthy control subjects, and the severity of all symptoms was similar and significantly worse in the two patient groups than in the control subjects (p < 0.001). In the two patient groups, particularly those with Long COVID, the NLT provoked a marked and progressive narrowing in the pulse pressure. All three cognitive measures of reaction time worsened in the two patient groups immediately following the NLT, compared to the healthy control subjects, particularly in the Procedural Reaction Time (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A test of orthostatic stress easily performed in an office setting reveals different symptomatic, hemodynamic and cognitive abnormalities in people with Long COVID and ME/CFS, compared to healthy control subjects. Thus, an orthostatic challenge easily performed in an office setting, and the use of a smart phone app to assess cognition, can provide objective confirmation of the orthostatic intolerance and brain fog reported by patients with Long COVID and ME/CFS.",

The purpose of this study was to look for factors that influence the type and severity of Long COVID symptoms. In total, 932 individuals with a history of COVID-19 were qualified for the study using an original questionnaire based on the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehab Screen (C19-YRS) questionnaire. Older adults were more likely to report problems with mobility (p < 0.001) and in performing daily activities (p = 0.014). Those with a higher BMI showed significantly more symptoms such as dyspnea at rest (p < 0.001) and on exertion (p < 0.001), feelings of chronic fatigue (p = 0.023), problems with mobility (p < 0.001), and in performing daily activities (p = 0.002).

Research has shown these events produce a systemic molecular inflammatory response and chronic immune activation and dysregulation. What has been more difficult to establish is the hierarchy of the physiological responses that give rise to the myriad of symptoms that ME/CFS patients experience, and why they do not resolve and are generally life-long. The severity of the symptoms frequently fluctuates through relapse recovery periods, with brain-centered symptoms of neuroinflammation, loss of homeostatic control, \"brain fog\" affecting cognitive ability, lack of refreshing sleep, and poor response to even small stresses. How these brain effects develop with ME/CFS from the initiating external effector, whether virus or other cause, is poorly understood and that is what our paper aims to address. We propose the hypothesis that following the initial stressor event, the subsequent systemic pathology moves to the brain via neurovascular pathways or through a dysfunctional blood-brain barrier (BBB), resulting in chronic neuroinflammation and leading to a sustained illness with chronic relapse recovery cycles. Signaling through recognized pathways from the brain back to body physiology is likely part of the process by which the illness cycle in the peripheral system is sustained and why healing does not occur. By contrast, Long COVID (Post-COVID-19 condition) is a very recent ME/CFS-like illness arising from the single pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2. We believe the ME/CFS-like ongoing effects of Long COVID are arising by very similar mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, but likely with some unique signaling, resulting from the pathology of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. The fact that there are very similar symptoms in both ongoing diseases, despite the diversity in the nature of the initial stressors, supports the concept of a similar dysfunctional CNS component common to both.",

There has been an understandable caution amongst some people experiencing long COVID that, by boosting their immune response, a COVID vaccine may exacerbate their symptoms. We aimed to survey people living with long COVID, evaluating the impact of their first COVID vaccination on their symptoms. METHODS: Patients with long COVID were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire through postings on social media and direct mailing from support groups. Basic demographics, range and severity of long COVID symptoms, before and after their vaccine, were surveyed. RESULTS: 900 people participated in the questionnaire, of whom 45 had pre-existing myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) but no evidence of COVID infection, and a further 43 did not complete the survey in full. The demographics and symptomology of the remaining 812 people were similar to those recorded by the UK Office of National Statistics. Following vaccination, 57.9% of participants reported improvements in symptoms, 17.9% reported deterioration and the remainder no change. There was considerable individual variation in responses. Larger improvements in symptom severity scores were seen in those receiving the mRNA vaccines compared to adenoviral vector vaccines.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to identify Long COVID research priorities using a citizen science approach and solely considering the needs of those affected. METHODS: This citizen science study followed an iterative process of patient needs identification, evaluation and prioritisation. A Long COVID Citizen Science Board (21 persons with Long COVID, and seven with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) and a Long COVID Working Group (25 persons with Long COVID, four patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and one relative) were formed. The study included four activities: three remote meetings and one online survey. First, Board members identified the needs and research questions. Second, Working Group members and persons affected by Long COVID (241 respondents, 85.5% with Long COVID, 14.5% with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and 7.1% relatives) evaluated the research questions on a 1-5 Likert scale using an online survey. Then the Board gave feedback on this evaluation. Finally, Board members set the priorities for research through voting and discussion. RESULTS: Sixty-eight research questions were generated by the Board and categorised into four research domains (medicine, healthcare services, socioeconomics and burden of disease) and 14 subcategories. Their average importance ratings were moderate to high and varied from 3.41 (standard deviation = 1.16) for sex-specific diagnostics to 4.86 (standard deviation = 0.41) for medical questions on treatment. Five topics were prioritised: \"treatment, rehabilitation and chronic care management\", \"availability of interfaces for treatment continuity\", \"availability of healthcare structures\", \"awareness and knowledge among professionals\" and \"prevalence of Long COVID in children and adolescents\".

Here, we present an analysis of a case series of the first 20 patients' data collected in clinical practice to evaluate the potential of a possible alternative treatment for Long COVID. METHODS: Face-to-face treatment sessions with Perrin technique practitioners occurred weekly involving effleurage/other manual articulatory techniques. The individuals being treated also undertook daily self-massage along with gentle mobility exercises. Patients recorded symptom severity using the self-report 54-item profile of fatigue-related states (PFRS) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of male patients was 41.8 years (range, 29-53 years), and for female patients, 39.3 years (range, 28-50 years). None of the participants had a prior diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, and all were new attendees to the clinics at the time of initial assessment. The average number of treatment sessions was 9.7 in men and 9.4 in women. The reduction in PFRS scores was 45% in men and 52% in women. The highest subscale scores on average were for fatigue, with the lowest for somatic symptoms. All subscale scores showed, on average, a similar reduction of approximately 50% postintervention, with the reduction in score relating to a decrease in the severity of symptoms.

        "abstract": "Whilst parallels have been drawn between Long Covid and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), there is a well-documented history of negative stereotyping and marginalisation of patients with ME/CFS. A socio-politically oriented comparison of scientific, clinical and societal responses to Long Covid and ME/CFS is thus important to prevent similar harms arising among Long Covid patients. We identify four reasons for injustices in the treatment of ME/CFS patients, and discuss the risk of Long Covid following a similar trajectory. We conclude with policy and practice recommendations to help prevent such injustices arising again, including consideration of critical reflexivity in medical education.",

        "title": "A Call to Use the Multicomponent Exercise Tai Chi to Improve Recovery From COVID-19 and Long COVID.",
        "abstract": "Approximately 10% of all COVID patients develop long COVID symptoms, which may persist from 1 month up to longer than 1 year. Long COVID may affect any organ/system and manifest in a broad range of symptoms such as shortness of breath, post-exercise malaise, cognitive decline, chronic fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal pain and deterioration of mental health. In this context, health institutions struggle with resources to keep up with the prolonged rehabilitation for the increasing number of individuals affected by long COVID. Tai Chi is a multicomponent rehabilitation approach comprising correct breathing technique, balance and neuromuscular training as well as stress- and emotional management. In addition, practicing Tai Chi elicits the relaxation response and balances the autonomic nervous system thus regulating respiration, heart rate, blood pressure and vitality in general. Moreover, Tai Chi has been shown to increase lung capacity, improve cognitive status and mental health, and thereby even the quality of life in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hence, we advocate Tai Chi as potent and suitable rehabilitation tool for post-COVID-19-affected individuals.",

        "title": "Is It Useful to Question the Recovery Behaviour of Patients with ME/CFS or Long COVID?",
        "abstract": "For the last few decades, medical guidelines have recommended treating patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) with graded exercise therapy (GET) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Moreover, doctors have questioned the recovery behaviour of these patients and stimulated them to follow these treatments so that they would be able to go back to work. In this article, we reviewed trials of GET and CBT for ME/CFS that reported on work status before and after treatment to answer the question of whether doctors should continue to question the recovery behaviour of patients with ME/CFS. Our review shows that more patients are unable to work after treatment than before treatment with CBT and GET. It also highlights the fact that both treatments are unsafe for patients with ME/CFS. Therefore, questioning the recovery behaviour of patients with ME/CFS is pointless. This confirms the conclusion from the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which has recently published its updated ME/CFS guideline and concluded that CBT and GET are not effective and do not lead to recovery. Studies on CBT and GET for long COVID have not yet been published. However, this review offers no support for their use in improving the recovery of patients with an ME/CFS-like illness after infection with COVID-19, nor does it lend any support to the practice of questioning the recovery behaviour of these patients.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: People living with long COVID describe a high symptom burden, and a more detailed assessment is needed to inform rehabilitation recommendations. The objectives were to use validated questionnaires to measure the severity of fatigue and compare this with normative data and thresholds for clinical relevance in other diseases; measure and describe the impact of postexertional malaise (PEM); and assess symptoms of dysfunctional breathing, self-reported physical activity, and health-related quality of life. METHODS: This was an observational study with a cross-sectional survey design (data collection from February 2021 to April 2021). Eligible participants were adults experiencing persistent symptoms due to COVID-19 that did not predate the confirmed or suspected infection. Questionnaires included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale and the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-Post-Exertional Malaise. RESULTS: After data cleaning, 213 participants were included in the analysis. The total Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale score was 18 (SD\u2009=\u200910) (where the score can range from 0 to 52, and a lower score indicates more severe fatigue), and 71.4% were experiencing chronic fatigue. Postexertional symptom exacerbation affected most participants, and 58.7% met the PEM scoring thresholds used in people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. CONCLUSION: Long COVID is characterized by chronic fatigue that is clinically relevant and at least as severe as fatigue in several other clinical conditions. PEM is a significant challenge for this patient group. Because of the potential for setbacks and deteriorated function following overexertion, fatigue and postexertional symptom exacerbation must be monitored and reported in clinical practice and in studies involving interventions for people with long COVID. IMPACT: Physical therapists working with people with long COVID should measure and validate the patient's experience. Postexertional symptom exacerbation must be considered, and rehabilitation needs to be carefully designed based on individual presentation. Beneficial interventions might first ensure symptom stabilization via pacing, a self-management strategy for the activity that helps minimize postexertional malaise.",

        "abstract": "In our article, we reconstruct how the patient-made term \"long COVID\" was able to become a widely accepted concept in public discourses. While the condition was initially invisible to the public eye, we show how the mobilization of subjective evidence online, i.e., the dissemination of reports on the different experiences of lasting symptoms, was able to transform the condition into a crucial feature of the coronavirus pandemic. We explore how stakeholders used the term \"long COVID\" in online media and in other channels to create their illness and group identity, but also to demarcate the personal experience and experiential knowledge of long COVID from that of other sources. Our exploratory study addresses two questions. Firstly, how the mobilization of subjective evidence leads to the recognition of long COVID and the development of treatment interventions in medicine; and secondly, what distinguishes these developments from other examples of subjective evidence mobilization. We argue that the long COVID movement was able to fill crucial knowledge gaps in the pandemic discourses, making long COVID a legitimate concern of official measures to counter the pandemic. By first showing how illness experiences were gathered that defied official classifications of COVID-19, we show how patients made the \"long COVID\" term. Then we compare the clinical and social identity of long COVID to that of chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), before we examine the social and epistemic processes at work in the digital and medial discourses that have transformed how the pandemic is perceived through the lens of long COVID. Building on this, we finally demonstrate how the alignment of medical professionals as patients with the movement has challenged the normative role of clinical evidence, leading to new forms of medical action to tackle the pandemic.",

Many of the symptoms characterized as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) could have multiple causes or are similarly seen in non-COVID patients. Accurate identification of PASC\u00a0phenotypes will be important to guide future research and help the healthcare system focus its efforts and resources on adequately controlled age- and gender-specific sequelae of a COVID-19 infection. METHODS: In this retrospective electronic health record (EHR) cohort study, we applied a computational framework for knowledge discovery from clinical data, MLHO, to identify phenotypes that positively associate with a past positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19. We evaluated the post-test phenotypes in two temporal windows at 3-6 and 6-9\u2009months after the test and by age and gender. Data from longitudinal diagnosis records stored in EHRs from Mass General Brigham in the Boston Metropolitan Area was used for the analyses. Statistical analyses were performed on data from March 2020 to June 2021. Study participants included over 96 thousand patients who had tested positive or negative for COVID-19 and were not hospitalized. RESULTS: We identified 33 phenotypes among different age/gender cohorts or time windows that were positively associated with past SARS-CoV-2 infection. All identified phenotypes were newly recorded in patients' medical records 2 months or longer after a COVID-19 RT-PCR test in non-hospitalized patients regardless of the test result. Among these phenotypes, a new diagnosis record for anosmia and dysgeusia (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.94-3.46]), alopecia (OR 3.09, 95% CI [2.53-3.76]), chest pain (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.09-1.48]), chronic fatigue syndrome (OR 2.60, 95% CI [1.22-2.10]), shortness of breath (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22-1.64]), pneumonia (OR 1.66, 95% CI [1.28-2.16]), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 1.41, 95% CI [1.22-1.64]) is one of the most significant indicators of a past COVID-19 infection. Additionally, more new phenotypes were found with increased confidence among the cohorts who were younger than 65. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study confirm many of the post-COVID-19 symptoms and suggest that a variety of new diagnoses, including new diabetes mellitus and neurological disorder diagnoses, are more common among those with a history of COVID-19 than those without the infection. Additionally, more than 63% of PASC phenotypes were observed in patients under 65\u2009years of age, pointing out the importance of vaccination to minimize the risk of debilitating post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 among younger adults.",

METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, in the form of an online survey. A total of 115 responses were finally included. RESULTS: The mean age was 73.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.42. Eighty-nine reported symptoms in the post-recovery period; of these 54 had no symptoms of CFS, 60 were possible, and only 1 was probable. Fatigue was reported by 66, musculoskeletal symptoms by 56, and sleep problems by 73. Twenty-nine patients visited a doctor's office as a result. Post-recovery symptoms were significantly related to stress, sadness and sleep disturbances. Also, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and recurrent falls were all significantly associated with CFS-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: From our findings, the presence of fatigue, cognitive impairment, stress, sadness, sleep disturbances and recurrent falls in the post-recovery period were all significantly associated with CFS-like symptoms.

We reviewed Pub Med, major medical meeting and medical journal, and investigative journalist materials seeking to frame and describe COVID-19 chronic disease. The consequences of COVID-19 infections follow major organ damage, and induction of immunological and hormonal systems dysfunction. The first injuries are consequent to direct viral effects on tissues, and vasculitis, endothelialitis, thrombosis and inflammatory events. Pulmonary, cardiac, brain, and kidney tissues incur function-limiting damage, with dyspnea, arrythmias, decreased exercise capacity, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased glomerular filtration rates. The second process is characterized by immune dysregulation and autoimmunity, and dysfunction of hormonal regulation systems, with high, fluctuating levels of physical and mental fatigue, multiple-site pain and ache, and non-restorative sleep, in 10-30% of cases.

Long COVID is thought to be linked to immune dysregulation due to harmful inflammation, with the exact causes being unknown. Given the role of the microbiome in mediating inflammation, we aimed to examine the relationship between the oral microbiome and the duration of long COVID symptoms. Tongue swabs were collected from patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms. Confirmed infections were followed until resolution of all symptoms. Bacterial composition was determined by metagenomic sequencing. We used random forest modeling to identify microbiota and clinical covariates that are associated with long COVID symptoms. Of the patients followed, 63% developed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 and 37% went on to long COVID. Patients with prolonged symptoms had significantly higher abundances of microbiota that induced inflammation, such as members of the genera Prevotella and Veillonella, which, of note, are species that produce LPS. The oral microbiome of patients with long COVID was similar to that of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Altogether, our findings suggest an association with the oral microbiome and long COVID, revealing the possibility that dysfunction of the oral microbiome may have contributed to this draining disease.",

Across the globe, a subset of patients who sustain an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are developing a wide range of persistent symptoms that do not resolve over the course of many months. These patients are being given the diagnosis Long COVID or Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). It is likely that individual patients with a PASC diagnosis have different underlying biological factors driving their symptoms, none of which are mutually exclusive. This paper details mechanisms by which RNA viruses beyond just SARS-CoV-2 have be connected to long-term health consequences. It also reviews literature on acute COVID-19 and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as post-Ebola syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) to discuss different scenarios for PASC symptom development. Potential contributors to PASC symptoms include consequences from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or multiple organs, persistent reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 in certain tissues, re-activation of neurotrophic pathogens such as herpesviruses under conditions of COVID-19 immune dysregulation, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation issues, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins.

This illness is poorly understood as it affects COVID-19 survivors at all levels of disease severity, even younger adults, children, and those not hospitalized. While the precise definition of long COVID may be lacking, the most common symptoms reported in many studies are fatigue and dyspnoea that last for months after acute COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms may include cognitive and mental impairments, chest and joint pains, palpitations, myalgia, smell and taste dysfunctions, cough, headache, and gastrointestinal and cardiac issues. Presently, there is limited literature discussing the possible pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatments in long COVID, which the current review aims to address. In brief, long COVID may be driven by long-term tissue damage (e.g. lung, brain, and heart) and pathological inflammation (e.g. from viral persistence, immune dysregulation, and autoimmunity). The associated risk factors may include female sex, more than five early symptoms, early dyspnoea, prior psychiatric disorders, and specific biomarkers (e.g. D-dimer, CRP, and lymphocyte count), although more research is required to substantiate such risk factors. While preliminary evidence suggests that personalized rehabilitation training may help certain long COVID cases, therapeutic drugs repurposed from other similar conditions, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome, also hold potential.

However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the terminology for this emerging chronic clinical syndrome, which includes long COVID, chronic COVID syndrome, post-COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute COVID-19, and long-hauler COVID-19. In this review, I will use the term \"long COVID\". A review of the medical history and epidemiology of past pandemics and epidemics in modern literature review identifies common long-term post-infectious disorders, with the common finding of altered cognition. In the brain, the cerebral hypoxia induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in \"brain fog\". Historically, the common symptom of altered cognition has been reported during earlier pandemics, which include the influenza pandemics of 1889 and 1892 (Russian flu), the Spanish flu pandemic (1918-1919), encephalitis lethargica, diphtheria, and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome or post-viral fatigue syndrome). There are similarities between chronic fatigue syndrome and the \"brain fog\" described in long COVID. During past viral epidemics and pandemics, a commonality of neural targets may have increased viral survival by conformational matching. The neurological and psychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or long COVID, may have emerged from neural effects that have emerged from an invertebrate and vertebrate virosphere. This review aims to present a historical overview of infections and disorders associated with neurological and psychiatric sequelae that have shown similarities with long COVID.",

        "title": "Antimicrobial therapies for chronic pain (part 2): the prevention and treatment of chronic pain.",
        "abstract": "The discovery and development of antimicrobial therapies represents one of the most significant advancements in modern medicine. Although the primary therapeutic intent of antimicrobials is to eliminate their target pathogens, several antimicrobials have been shown to provide analgesia as a secondary benefit. Antimicrobials have demonstrated analgesic effects in conditions that involve dysbiosis or potential subclinical infection (e.g ., chronic low back pain with Modic type 1 changes; chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain; irritable bowel syndrome; inflammatory bowel disease; functional gastrointestinal disorders/dyspepsia; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome), and might even prevent the chronification of pain after acute infections that are associated with excessive systemic inflammation (e.g ., post COVID-19 condition/long Covid, rheumatic fever). Clinical studies often assess the analgesic effects of antimicrobial therapies in an observational manner, without the ability to identify causative relationships, and significant gaps in the understanding remain regarding the analgesic potential of antimicrobials. Numerous interrelated patient-specific, antimicrobial-specific, and disease-specific factors altogether contribute to the perception and experience of pain, and each of these requires further study. Given worldwide concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobials must continue to be used judiciously and are unlikely to be repurposed as primary analgesic medications. However, when equipoise exists among several antimicrobial treatment options, the potential analgesic benefits of certain antimicrobial agents might be a valuable aspect to consider in clinical decision-making. This article (the second in a two-part series) aims to comprehensively review the evidence on the prevention and treatment of chronic pain using antimicrobial therapies and suggest a framework for future studies on this topic.",

        "abstract": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disabling disorder characterized by disrupted daily patterns of activity, sleep, and physiology. Past studies in ME/CFS patients have examined circadian rhythms, suggested that desynchronization between central and peripheral rhythms may be an important pathological feature, and identified associated changes in post-inflammatory cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFB). However, no previous studies have examined circadian rhythms in ME/CFS using cellular models or studied the role of cytokines on circadian rhythms. In this study, we used serum samples previously collected from ME/CFS patients (n\u00a0=\u00a020) selected for the presence of insomnia symptoms and matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a020) to determine the effects of serum factors and TGFB on circadian rhythms in NIH3T3 mouse immortalized fibroblasts stably transfected with the Per2-luc bioluminescent circadian reporter. Compared to control serum, ME/CFS serum caused a significant loss of rhythm robustness (decreased goodness of fit) and nominally increased the rate of damping of cellular rhythms. Damping rate was associated with insomnia severity in ME/CFS patients using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Recombinant TGFB1 peptide applied to cells reduced rhythm amplitude, caused phase delay and decreased robustness of rhythms. However, there was no difference in TGFB1 levels between ME/CFS and control serum indicating the effects of serum on cellular rhythms cannot be explained by levels of this cytokine. Future studies will be required to identify additional serum factors in ME/CFS patients that alter circadian rhythms in cells.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between the Big Five personality traits, chronotype and severity of fatigue symptoms, in the context of selected clinical variables and general mental health among patients with sarcoidosis. METHODS: The study group comprised 60 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis. They were asked to share relevant clinical data and complete a set of questionnaires: Fatigue Asessment Scale (FAS), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the NEO Five Factor Inventory and Composite Scale of Morningness. RESULTS: In linear regression analysis, FAS score was predicted by female sex, active sarcoidosis status, Morning Affect and Conscientiousness. In principal component analysis, FAS score and all GHQ-28 subscale scores (somatic symptoms, anxiety/insomnia, social dysfunction and depressive symptoms) formed a single component explaining 60% of variance. The factor loading for each variable exceeded 0.6. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological burden appeared to rise with the severity of the fatigue, regardless the inactive/active phase of sarcoidosis. The severity of fatigue may be linked to patient's poor morning affect. The profile of psychological burden presented by the patients may be associated with their personality and clinical presentation of sarcoidosis.",

This multicenter, randomized, controlled study intended to explore the potential benefit of CBSM in ameliorating the anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: A total of 250 AMI patients who received PCI were randomly allocated to the CBSM (N\u2009=\u2009125) and control care (CC) (N\u2009=\u2009125) groups, and underwent weekly corresponding interventions for 12\u00a0weeks. The hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), and EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) scores were evaluated at baseline (M0), month (M)1, M3, and M6. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were recorded during follow-up. RESULTS: HADS-anxiety score at M1 (P\u2009=\u20090.036), M3 (P\u2009=\u20090.002), and M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.001), as well as anxiety rate at M6 (P\u2009=\u20090.026), was reduced in the CBSM group versus the CC group.

        "abstract": "Several studies have described the contribution of glutamate-transforming microbiota to the development of chronic ailments. For instance, the blood concentration of glutamate is higher in some patients with fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and pain. Taking advantage of a naturally occurring strain of Bifidobacterium that is able to transform glutamate in \u03b3-aminobutyric caid (GABA), B. adolescentis IPLA60004, we designed a placebo-controlled intervention to test if the presence of this GABA-producing bifidobacteria in mice was able to impact the concentration of glutamate in the blood in comparison with the administration of other strain of the same species lacking the genes of the glutamate decarboxylase (gad) cluster. Animals were fed every day with 8 log CFU of bacteria in a sterilized milk vehicle for 14\u2009days. Samples from feces and blood were collected during this period, and afterwards animals were sacrificed, tissues were taken from different organs, and the levels of different metabolites were analyzed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The results showed that both bacterial strains orally administered survived in the fecal content, and animals fed B. adolescentis IPLA60004 showed a significant reduction of their glutamate serum concentration, while a nonsignificant decrease was observed for animals fed a reference strain, B. adolescentis LGM10502. The variations observed in GABA were influenced by the gender of the animals, and no significant changes were observed in different tissues of the brain. These results suggest that orally administered GABA-producing probiotics could reduce the glutamate concentration in blood, opening a case for a clinical trial study in chronic disease patients. IMPORTANCE This work presents the results of a trial using mice as a model that were fed with a bacterial strain of the species B. adolescentis, which possesses different active genes capable of degrading glutamate and converting it into GABA. Indeed, the bacterium is able to survive the passage through the gastric tract and, more importantly, the animals reduce over time the concentration of glutamate in their blood. The importance of this result lies in the fact that several chronic ailments, such as fibromyalgia, are characterized by an increase in glutamate. Our results indicate that an oral diet with this probiotic-type bacteria could reduce the concentration of glutamate and, therefore, reduce the symptoms associated with the excess of this neurotransmitter.",

Here, we sought to compare the HrQoL in individuals with POTS to a normative age-/sex-matched population. METHODS: Participants enrolled in the Australian POTS registry between 5 August 2021 and 30 June 2022 were compared with propensity-matched local normative population data from the South Australian Health Omnibus Survey. The EQ-5D-5L instrument was used to assess HrQoL across the five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with global health rating assessed with a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). A population-based scoring algorithm was applied to the EQ-5D-5L data to calculate utility scores. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were undertaken to explore predictors of low utility scores. RESULTS: A total of 404 participants (n\u2009=\u2009202 POTS; n\u2009=\u2009202 normative population; median age 28\u00a0years, 90.6% females) were included. Compared with the normative population, the POTS cohort demonstrated significantly higher burden of impairment across all EQ-5D-5L domains (all P\u2009<\u20090.001), lower median EQ-VAS (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and lower utility scores (p\u2009<\u2009.001). The lower EQ-VAS and utility scores in the POTS cohort were universal in all age groups. Severity of orthostatic intolerance symptoms, female sex, fatigue scores, and comorbid diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome were independent predictors of reduced HrQoL in POTS. The disutility in those with POTS was lower than many chronic health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate significant impairment across all subdomains of EQ-5D-5L HrQoL in the POTS cohort as compared with a normative population.

This study aimed to report the incidence and contributing factors of non-RCT teeth with chronic fatigue root fracture in a Taiwanese population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included teeth extracted at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan between 2018 and 2019. The reasons for extractions were recorded and included vertical and horizontal root fractures (VRF and HRF). Comparisons of clinical factors between teeth with fatigue VRF and teeth with fatigue HRF were performed by chi-square or Fisher exact test, where appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 4207 extracted teeth examined, 263 (6.25%) had tooth fracture. Thirty-two non-RCT teeth had chronic fatigue root fracture, including 16 with VRF and 16 with HRF. The incidence was 0.76% (32/4207). The occurrence of chronic fatigue root fracture was higher in males (83.9%).

A grey literature search was also conducted to identify additional guidelines and national recommendations to identify the role of psychiatry in the diagnosis and treatment of pCFS. SUMMARY: The search provided 436 articles of which 16 met inclusion criteria. Grey literature search identified 12 relevant guidelines. Most studies and guidelines did not include any psychiatric involvement in the care of patients with pCFS. If psychiatry was mentioned, it was used interchangeably with psychological interventions or in the context of treating distinct psychiatric comorbidities and suicidal ideation.

However, this has yet to be investigated in the pediatric ME/CFS population. We examined group differences in macrostructural and microstructural white matter properties, and their relationship with clinical measures, between adolescents recently diagnosed with ME/CFS and healthy controls. Forty-eight adolescents (25 ME/CFS, 23 controls, mean age 16\u2009years) underwent brain diffusion MRI, and a robust multi-analytic approach was used to evaluate white and gray matter volume, regional brain volume, cortical thickness, fractional anisotropy, mean/axial/radial diffusivity, neurite dispersion and density, fiber density, and fiber cross section. From a clinical perspective, adolescents with ME/CFS showed greater fatigue and pain, poorer sleep quality, and poorer performance on cognitive measures of processing speed and sustained attention compared with controls. However, no significant group differences in white matter properties were observed, with the exception of greater white matter fiber cross section of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the ME/CFS group compared with controls, which did not survive correction for intracranial volume. Overall, our findings suggest that white matter abnormalities may not be predominant in pediatric ME/CFS in the early stages following diagnosis.

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with obscure aetiology. The underdiagnosis rate of ME/CFS is high due to the lack of diagnostic criteria based on objective markers. In recent years, circRNAs have emerged as potential genetic biomarkers for neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, making them likely to have the same prospect of being biomarkers in ME/CFS. However, despite the extensive amount of research that has been performed on the transcriptomes of ME/CFS patients, all of them are solely focused on linear RNAs, and the profiling of circRNAs in ME/CFS has been completely omitted. In this study, we investigated the expression profiles of circRNAs, comparing ME/CFS patients and controls before and after two sessions of cardiopulmonary exercise longitudinally. In patients with ME/CFS, the number of detected circRNAs was higher compared to healthy controls, indicating potential differences in circRNA expression associated with the disease. Additionally, healthy controls showed an increase in the number of circRNAs following exercise testing, while no similar pattern was evident in ME/CFS patients, further highlighting physiological differences between the two groups. A lack of correlation was observed between differentially expressed circRNAs and their corresponding coding genes in terms of expression and function, suggesting the potential of circRNAs as independent biomarkers in ME/CFS. Specifically, 14 circRNAs were highly expressed in ME/CFS patients but absent in controls throughout the exercise study, indicating a unique molecular signature specific to ME/CFS patients and providing potential diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. Significant enrichment of protein and gene regulative pathways were detected in relation to five of these 14 circRNAs based on their predicted miRNA target genes.

In the present study, we move beyond the traditional variable-centered approach and adopt a person-centered approach by considering antecedents and outcomes of sleep profiles. Specifically, we consider job characteristics (i.e., workload, job control, and their interaction) as predictors of sleep profiles and indicators of chronic fatigue (i.e., prolonged fatigue and burnout) as outcomes. In establishing sleep profiles, we consider levels as well as the variability of the sleep dimensions across a week. Based on daily diary data from 296 Indonesian employees, the present article uses latent profile analysis to identify sleep profiles based on both weekly averages of several sleep dimensions (i.e., sleep quality, fragmentation, duration, bedtime, and wake-up time) and their intraindividual variability. Moreover, it explores the relationship between the identified profiles to prolonged fatigue and burnout 2 weeks later as outcomes, as well as to baseline workload, job control, and their interaction as predictors. We find four different profiles (\"Average Sleepers,\" \"Deep Owls,\" \"Short Sleep Compensators,\" and \"Restless Erratic Sleepers\"). While workload, job control, and their interaction could not predict profile membership, these profiles relate differently to prolonged fatigue and burnout. As such, our study shows the importance of understanding the combination of sleep levels and variability across a week through sleep profiles, and how they differentially relate to symptoms of chronic fatigue.

PURPOSE: This study's purpose is to provide insight into people's experiences of suffering and recovery from very severe CFS/ME and illuminate understanding of how and why changes became possible. METHODS: Fourteen former patients were interviewed about their experiences of returning to health. A narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participants' experiences and understandings. We present the result through one participant's story. RESULTS: The analysis yielded a common plotline with a distinct turning point. Participants went through a profound narrative shift, change in mindset and subsequent long-time work to actively pursue their own healing. Their narrative understandings of being helpless victims of disease were replaced by a more complex view of causality and illness and a new sense of self-agency developed. DISCUSSION: We discuss the illness narratives in relation to the disease model and its shortcomings, the different voices dominating the stories at different times in a clinically, conceptually, and emotionally challenging area.",
        "reason": "The text does not present new experimental data or results but instead synthesizes conclusions from multiple studies (in this case, interviews with 14 former patients) to offer a comprehensive overview of the experiences and understandings of people recovering from severe chronic fatigue syndrome. The paper critically examines simplified medical models, discusses the disease model and its shortcomings, and suggests areas for further research."

        "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have overlapping symptoms, and differentiation is important to administer the proper treatment. The present study aimed to assess the usefulness of heart rate variability (HRV) indices. Frequency-domain HRV indices, including high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components, their sum (LF+HF), and their ratio (LF/HF), were measured in a three-behavioral-state paradigm composed of initial rest (Rest), task load (Task), and post-task rest (After) periods to examine autonomic regulation. It was found that HF was low at Rest in both disorders, but was lower in MDD than in CFS. LF and LF+HF at Rest were low only in MDD. Attenuated responses of LF, HF, LF+HF, and LF/HF to task load and an excessive increase in HF at After were found in both disorders. The results indicate that an overall HRV reduction at Rest may support a diagnosis of MDD. HF reduction was found in CFS, but with a lesser severity. Response disturbances of HRV to Task were observed in both disorders, and would suggest the presence of CFS when the baseline HRV has not been reduced. Linear discriminant analysis using HRV indices was able to differentiate MDD from CFS, with a sensitivity and specificity of 91.8% and 100%, respectively. HRV indices in MDD and CFS show both common and different profiles, and can be useful for the differential diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) shares many features with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). PCS represents a major health issue worldwide because it severely impacts patients' work activities and their quality of life. In the absence of treatment for both conditions and given the beneficial effect of pacing strategies in ME/CFS, we conducted this study to assess the effectiveness of pacing in PCS patients. METHODS: We retrospectively included patients meeting the World Health Organization definition of PCS who attended the Internal Medicine Department of Angers University Hospital, France between June 2020 and June 2022, and were followed up until December 2022. Pacing strategies were systematically proposed for all patients. Their medical records were reviewed and data related to baseline and follow-up assessments were collected. This included epidemiological characteristics, COVID-19 symptoms and associated conditions, fatigue features, perceived health status, employment activity, and the degree of pacing adherence assessed by the engagement in pacing subscale (EPS). Recovery was defined as the ability to return to work, and improvement was regarded as the reduction of the number and severity of symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients were included and followed-up for a median time of 10 [6-13] months. Recovery and improvement rates were 33.7% and 23.3%, respectively. The EPS score was the only variable significantly associated with recovery on multivariate analysis (OR 40.43 [95% CI 6.22-262.6], p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients who better adhered to pacing (high EPS scores) experienced significantly higher recovery and improvement rates (60-33.3% respectively) than those with low (5.5-5.5% respectively), or moderate (4.3-17.4% respectively) scores. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that pacing is effective in the management of patients with PCS, and that high levels of adherence to pacing are associated with better outcomes.",

This research investigates the psychoneuroimmunoendocrine disorders of FM patients and ascertains whether a previous CFS diagnosis affected them. Through accelerometry objective parameters, physical activity/sedentarism levels in relation to fatigue are studied, as well as whether perceived levels of stress, anxiety, and pain correspond to objective biomarkers, all of these with respect to a reference group (RG) of women without FM. FM patients have a worse psychological state and perceived quality of life than those with RG. These perceived outcomes are consistent with impaired objective levels of a sedentary lifestyle, higher systemic levels of cortisol and noradrenaline, and lower levels of serotonin. However, FM patients with a previous CFS diagnosis had lower systemic levels of IL-8, cortisol, oxytocin, and higher levels of adrenaline and serotonin than FM patients without diagnosed CFS. In conclusion, while perceived health parameters do not detect differences, when objective neuroimmunoendocrine parameters related to stress, inflammation, pain, and fatigue are used, people with CFS could be overdiagnosed with FM. This reinforces the need for objective biomarker assessment of these patients for better diagnostic discrimination between both syndromes.",

The current study aimed to assess the relation of illness worsening to the trajectories of social and non-social uplifts and hassles in a six-month prospective study in CFS. Methods: Participants were primarily in their 40s, female, white, and ill for over a decade. All participants (N=128) met criteria for CFS. The interview-based global impression of change rating was used to classify individual outcomes as improved, unchanged, or worsened at six- month follow-up. Uplifts and hassles, both social and non-social, were assessed with the Combined Hassles and Uplifts Scale (CHUS). The CHUS was administered weekly in online diaries over six months. Linear mixed effect models were utilized to examine linear trends for hassles and uplifts. Results: No significant differences were found between the three global outcome groups for age, sex, or illness duration; however, work status was significantly lower for the non-improved groups ( p <.001). Non-social hassles intensity showed an increasing slope for the worsened group ( p =.03) and a decreasing slope ( p =0.05) for the improved group. For the worsened group, a downward trend was found for frequency of non-social ( p =0.01) uplifts. Conclusion: Individuals with worsening as compared to improving illness in CFS show significantly different six-month trajectories for weekly hassles and a deficit in uplifts.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of a secondary data analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. SETTING: An Australian nationally representative sample of general population of children. PARTICIPANTS: 15 610 children-waves aged 6-14 years. INTERVENTION/EXPOSURE: Children reported to have at least 1 of the 21 CPCs by their parents. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinically relevant SEBDs were defined using standardised cut-offs of the parent-administered Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. RESULTS: Children with a CPC have significantly increased odds of total, internalising and externalising SEBDs than those without (total SEBDs, adjusted odds rartio or OR 3.13, 95% CI 2.52 to 3.89), controlling for sex, age, socioeconomic status and parental mental health status. The highest prevalence of total SEBDs was found in children with chronic fatigue (43.8%), epilepsy (33.8%) and day wetting (31.6%). An increasing number of comorbid CPCs was associated with a rising prevalence of SEBDs. On average, 24.2% of children with at least four CPCs had SEBDs. These children had 8.83-fold increased odds (95% CI 6.9 to 11.31) of total SEBDs compared with children without a CPC. Age was positively related to the odds of SEBDs.

People who suffer from these contested illnesses arguably also suffer from \"epistemic injustice.\" This concept, coined by the philosopher Miranda Fricker, captures how people's knowledge may be discredited because of identity prejudices. In our paper, this concept is used to understand how seven Dutch women with contested illnesses experience the emancipatory potential of their vlogging practices. Our findings show how these women understood their vlogging as a means to break with epistemic smothering, understood as the propensity to cater ones testimony to one's audience (Dotson, 2011), and as a means to attain and enhance epistemic justice. However, our findings also show how vlogging about contested illnesses did not seem to allow these women to fully break with their epistemic smothering practices, and that the ableist design and gendered norms of YouTube were experienced as obstacles to attaining epistemic justice.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, heterogenous disease characterized by unexplained persistent fatigue and other features including cognitive impairment, myalgias, post-exertional malaise, and immune system dysfunction. Cytokines are present in plasma and encapsulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs), but there have been only a few reports of EV characteristics and cargo in ME/CFS. Several small studies have previously described plasma proteins or protein pathways that are associated with ME/CFS. METHODS: We prepared extracellular vesicles (EVs) from frozen plasma samples from a cohort of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) cases and controls with prior published plasma cytokine and plasma proteomics data. The cytokine content of the plasma-derived extracellular vesicles was determined by a multiplex assay and differences between patients and controls were assessed. We then performed multi-omic statistical analyses that considered not only this new data, but extensive clinical data describing the health of the subjects. RESULTS: ME/CFS cases exhibited greater size and concentration of EVs in plasma. Assays of cytokine content in EVs revealed IL2 was significantly higher in cases. We observed numerous correlations among EV cytokines, among plasma cytokines, and among plasma proteins from mass spectrometry proteomics. Significant correlations between clinical data and protein levels suggest roles of particular proteins and pathways in the disease. For example, higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines Granulocyte-Monocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (CSF2) and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF\u03b1) were correlated with greater physical and fatigue symptoms in ME/CFS cases. Higher serine protease SERPINA5, which is involved in hemostasis, was correlated with higher SF-36 general health scores in ME/CFS. Machine learning classifiers were able to identify a list of 20 proteins that could discriminate between cases and controls, with XGBoost providing the best classification with 86.1% accuracy and a cross-validated AUROC value of 0.947. Random Forest distinguished cases from controls with 79.1% accuracy and an AUROC value of 0.891 using only 7 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These findings add to the substantial number of objective differences in biomolecules that have been identified in individuals with ME/CFS. The observed correlations of proteins important in immune responses and hemostasis with clinical data further implicates a disturbance of these functions in ME/CFS.",

In recent years, data on potential applications of WBC in multiple clinical settings have emerged. SOURCES OF DATA: PubMed, EBSCO and Clinical Key search using keywords including terms 'whole body', 'cryotherapy' and 'cryostimulation'. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: WBC could be applied as adjuvant therapy in multiple conditions involving chronic inflammation because of its potent anti-inflammatory effects. Those might include systemic inflammation as in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, WBC could serve as adjuvant therapy for chronic inflammation in some patients with obesity. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: WBC probably might be applied as an adjuvant treatment in patients with chronic brain disorders including mild cognitive impairment and general anxiety disorder and in patients with depressive episodes and neuroinflammation reduction as in multiple sclerosis. WBC effects in metabolic disorder treatment are yet to be determined. WBC presumably exerts pleiotropic effects and therefore might serve as adjuvant therapy in multi-systemic disorders, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). GROWING POINTS: The quality of studies on the effects of WBC in the clinical setting is in general low; hence, randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and longer follow-up periods are needed. AREAS ARE TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: Further studies should examine the mechanism underlying the clinical efficacy of WBC.

        "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease with no symptomatic treatment. Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), a component derived from the traditional Chinese medicine A. membranaceus, has significant anti-fatigue activity. However, the mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of APS on CFS remain poorly understood. A CFS model of 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice was established using the multiple-factor method. These mice underwent examinations for behavior, oxidative stress and inflammatory indicators in brain and intestinal tissues, and ileum histomorphology. 16\u00a0S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that APS regulated the abundance of gut microbiota and increased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and anti-inflammatory bacteria. In addition, APS reversed the abnormal expression of Nrf2, NF-\u03baB, and their downstream factors in the brain-gut axis and alleviated the reduction in SCFAs in the cecal content caused by CFS. Further, APS modulated the changes in serum metabolic pathways induced by CFS. Finally, it was verified that butyrate exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in neuronal cells. In conclusion, APS could increase the SCFAs content by regulating the gut microbiota, and SCFAs (especially butyrate) can further regulate the oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, thus alleviating CFS. This study explored the efficacy and mechanism of APS for CFS from the perspective of gut-brain axis and provides a reference to further explore the efficacy of APS and the role of SCFAs in the central nervous system.",

Currently, the incidence of PCS is estimated to be approximately 15% of all symptomatically infected patients, although over- or underestimations may occur due to the soft definition and lack of control groups. The etiology of PCS is currently unknown. The following pathogenetic processes are discussed in particular: an endothelial dysfunction with microcirculatory disturbances and subsequent organ damage, a\u00a0residual virus or virus particles, and/or an excessive autoimmune process.

No study has explored peripheral indicators of neuroaxis damage in MDD in relation to serum inflammatory and insulin resistance (IR) biomarkers, calcium, and the physio-affective phenome consisting of depressive, anxious, chronic fatigue, and physiosomatic symptoms. METHODS: Serum levels of phosphorylated tau protein 217 (P-tau217), platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR), neurofilament light chain (NF-L), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium and the HOMA2-insulin resistance (IR) index were measured in 94 MDD patients and 47 controls. RESULTS: 61.1\u00a0% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome (conceptualized as a factor extracted from depression, anxiety, fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms) is explained by the regression on GFAP, NF-L, P-tau2017, PDGFR\u03b2 and HOMA2-IR (all positively associated), and decreased calcium. In addition, CRP and HOMA2-IR predicted 28.9\u00a0% of the variance in the neuroaxis index. We observed significant indirect effects of CRP and calcium on the physio-affective phenome which were partly mediated by the four neuroaxis biomarkers. Annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that the enlarged GFAP, P-tau217, PDGFR, and NF-L network was enriched in glial cell and neuronal projections, the cytoskeleton and axonal transport, including a mitochondrion. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral inflammation and IR may damage the astroglial and neuronal projections thereby interfering with mitochondrial transport. This neurotoxicity, combined with inflammation, IR and lowered calcium, may, at least in part, induce the phenome of MDD.",
        "reason": "The provided text focuses on analyzing specific genes (GFAP, NF-L, P-tau217, PDGFR) and their relationship with diseases (MDD), as well as integrating both wet lab experiments (measuring serum levels of biomarkers) and dry lab analysis (statistical analysis to determine the correlation between the biomarkers and the physio-affective phenome). It also elucidates the regulatory interactions between these genes, mentioning their role in neuronal circuits and axonal transport."

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this pilot registry study was to evaluate the efficacy of Robuvit\u00ae (oak wood extract) on residual fatigue due to convalescence in otherwise healthy subjects within one month after surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. Robuvit\u00ae has been clinically tested in subjects with fatigue (chronic fatigue syndrome), post-traumatic stress disorder, convalescence and burnout. METHODS: One group of patients followed the standard management (SM) and was designated as control group while the supplementation group followed the SM and additionally took two Robuvit\u00ae capsules daily for six weeks (200 mg/day).The main study endpoints were the Karnofsky performance scale index, handgrip strength in kg, fitness test score on a treadmill, self-assessed work ability, fatigue score, oxidative stress and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) plasma levels. In addition, the mood of the patients was assessed using the 'brief mood introspection scale', BMIS. RESULTS: Fifty-one subjects with fatigue linked to convalescence within 1 month after chemotherapy for colon cancer completed the study, 29 in the Robuvit\u00ae group and 22 as controls. The two management groups were comparable for age and sex distribution. The main investigation parameters were also comparable at inclusion. No side effects or tolerability problems were observed in the six weeks of follow-up. Occasional use of painkillers, antinausea medication or anti-inflammatory agents was accepted. After six weeks, Robuvit\u00ae supplementation significantly improved the Karnofsky performance scale index compared to controls. Hand grip strength (dynamometry), treadmill fitness test score and the self-assessed work ability were significantly improved with Robuvit\u00ae as well. The fatigue score after six weeks was significantly improved with Robuvit\u00ae (P<0.05) in comparison with SM controls. Mood was significantly improved after 6 weeks in the Robuvit\u00ae patients compared to the control group. The examined study parameters improved in the patients of the control group as well, during a normal postchemotherapy convalescence, but in a lesser extend when compared to the supplementation group. Oxidative stress was high at inclusion in both groups. The decrease in oxidative stress - as plasma free radicals - was significantly higher with the supplementation (P<0.05). CEA values were within the normal values from inclusion and in the 6 weeks of the registry in all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, Robuvit\u00ae helps to reduce fatigue after chemotherapy and improves strength, performance, fitness, work ability and mood in these patients, without exposing them to the risk of side effects.",

        "abstract": "ME/CFS is a debilitating chronic condition that often develops after viral or bacterial infection. Insight from the study of Long COVID/Post Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), the post-viral syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, might prove to be useful for understanding pathophysiological mechanisms of ME/CFS. Disease presentation is similar between the two conditions, and a subset of Long COVID patients meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Since Long COVID is characterized by significant vascular pathology - including endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and vascular dysregulation - the question of whether or not the same biological abnormalities are of significance in ME/CFS arises. Cardiac abnormalities have for a while now been documented in ME/CFS cohorts, with recent studies demonstrating major deficits in cerebral blood flow, and hence vascular dysregulation. A growing body of research is demonstrating that ME/CFS is accompanied by platelet hyperactivation, anomalous clotting, a procoagulant phenotype, and endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial damage and dysregulated clotting can impair substance exchange between blood and tissues, and result in hypoperfusion, which may contribute to the manifestation of certain ME/CFS symptoms. Here we review the ME/CFS literature to summarize cardiovascular and haematological findings documented in patients with the condition, and, in this context, briefly discuss the potential role of previously-implicated pathogens. Overall, cardiac and haematological abnormalities are present within ME/CFS cohorts. While atherosclerotic heart disease is not significantly associated with ME/CFS, suboptimal cardiovascular function defined by reduced cardiac output, impaired cerebral blood flow, and vascular dysregulation are, and these abnormalities do not appear to be influenced by deconditioning. Rather, these cardiac abnormalities may result from dysfunction in the (autonomic) nervous system. Plenty of recently published studies are demonstrating significant platelet hyperactivity and endothelial dysfunction in ME/CFS, as well as anomalous clotting processes. It is of particular importance to determine to what extent these cardiovascular and haematological abnormalities contribute to symptom severity, and if these two systems can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. Viral reservoirs of herpesviruses exist in ME/CFS, and most likely contribute to cardiovascular and haematological dysfunction directly or indirectly. This review highlights the potential of studying cardiac functioning, the vasculature, and coagulation system in ME/CFS.",

However, the nature and magnitude of sleep architecture alteration in ME/CFS is not known, with studies using objective sleep measures in ME/CFS generating contradictory results. The current manuscript aimed to review and meta-analyse of case-control studies with objective sleep measures in ME/CSF.

Adult ME/CFS patients spend longer time in bed, longer sleep onset latency, longer awake time after sleep onset, reduced sleep efficiency, decreased stage 2 sleep, more Stage 3, and longer rapid eye movement sleep latency. However, adolescent ME/CFS patients had longer time in bed, longer total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and reduced sleep efficiency.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex chronic and debilitating multifactorial disease. Adequate patient care is challenged by poor knowledge among health care professionals and the historical misconception that the disease is psychological in nature. This study assessed the health-related challenges faced by patients with ME/CFS in Switzerland and examined whether they receive adequate health care. METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire between June and September of 2021, among 169 patients with ME/CFS in Switzerland. RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 38.8 years. Only one-third of ME/CFS affected children and youth were correctly diagnosed before their 18th birthday. The mean time from disease onset to diagnosis was 6.7 years, and patients had an average of 11.1 different appointments and 2.6 misdiagnoses. A poor diagnosis rate and insufficient disease knowledge among health professionals in Switzerland led 13.5% of the patients to travel abroad to seek a diagnosis. Most patients (90.5%) were told at least once that their symptoms were psychosomatic. Swiss patients expressed high dissatisfaction with the health system and indicated that physicians lacked knowledge regarding ME/CFS. Therapies prescribed by physicians or tried by patients, as well as their perceived efficacy, were described. Graded Exercise Therapy (GET) was perceived as harmful by patients, whereas pacing, complementary/alternative medicine, and dietary supplements and medications to alleviate symptoms were reported to be helpful to varying degrees. CONCLUSION: This study highlights that poor disease knowledge among health care providers in Switzerland has led to high patient dissatisfaction, and delays in ME/CFS diagnoses and prescription of inappropriate therapies, thus adding to patient distress and disease burden.",

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to characterize gastric motility and gastric symptoms in response to a liquid meal. METHODS: We included 20 patients with ME/CFS with abdominal complaints who were recruited to a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of Rituximab. The patients of this sub study were examined with an ultrasound drink test, and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated using the Rome III questionnaire and Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) questionnaire. RESULTS: We found that patients commonly reported fullness/bloating (75%), abdominal pain (45%) and nausea (35%). Ultrasound measurements revealed lower proximal measurements of the stomach after a meal (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and larger fasting antral area (p\u2009=\u20090.019) compared to healthy controls.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the antifatigue effect of P. ginseng on chronic fatigue rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, model and EEP (ethanol extraction of P. ginseng roots) (50, 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg) groups (n\u2009=\u20098). The rats were subcutaneously handled with loaded swimming once daily for 26\u00a0days, except for the control group. The animals were intragastrically treated with EEP from the 15th day. On day 30, serum, liver and muscles were collected, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway was evaluated.

Knowledge on long-term late effects after radiotherapy (RT) and potential underlying biological mechanisms is lacking. We assessed the prevalence of xerostomia, dysphagia, and chronic fatigue (CF) in HNC survivors\u2009\u2265\u20095\u00a0years post-RT, and examined associations between pro-inflammatory cytokines and late effects. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 263 HNC survivors treated between 2007 and 2013 were enrolled. They completed validated questionnaires assessing xerostomia and dysphagia (the EORTC QLQ-H&N35), and CF (the Fatigue Questionnaire), and underwent blood sampling and clinical examination. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in 262 survivors and 100 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. RESULTS: Median time since treatment was 8.5\u00a0years. The proportions of survivors reporting xerostomia, dysphagia, and CF were 58%, 31%, and 33%, respectively, with a preponderance of females. We found no significant associations between IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, TARC, TNF, or ENA-78 and the three late effects. The odds of having elevated levels of IL-6 and IP-10 were significantly higher in the survivors compared to the controls. CONCLUSIONS: More than one-third of long-term HNC survivors experienced xerostomia, dysphagia, and CF. Persistent inflammation, with elevated systemic cytokines, was not associated with these late effects, although HNC survivors had higher levels of some cytokines than the controls.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for severe fatigue. Changes in patients' fatigue scores following CBT might reflect not only the intended relief in fatigue but also response shift, a change in the meaning of patients' self-evaluation. Objectives were to (1) identify the occurrence of response shift in patients undergoing CBT, (2) determine the impact of response shift on the intervention effect, and (3) investigate whether changes in fatigue-related cognitions and perceptions, targeted during CBT, are associated with response shift. METHODS: Data of three randomized controlled trials testing the efficacy of CBT in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, n\u2009=\u2009222), cancer (n\u2009=\u2009123), and diabetes (n\u2009=\u2009107) were re-analyzed. Fatigue severity was measured with 8 items from the Checklist Individual Strength, a valid and widely used self-report questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was applied to assess lack of longitudinal measurement invariance, as indication of response shift. RESULTS: As expected, in all three trials, response shift was indicated in the CBT groups, not the control groups. Response shift through reprioritization was indicated for the items \"Physically, I feel exhausted\" (CFS) and \"I tire easily\" (cancer, diabetes), which became less vs. more important to the measurement of fatigue, respectively. However, this did not affect the intervention effects. Some changes in cognitions and perceptions were associated with the response shifts. CONCLUSIONS: CBT seems to induce response shift\u00a0through reprioritization across patient groups, but its occurrence does not affect the intervention effect. Future research should corroborate these findings and investigate whether patients indeed change their understanding of fatigue.",

The review aims to see whether homoeopathy can help COVID-19 survivors recover from its consequences and improve their quality of life. CONTENT: A systematic search of published articles for post-COVID sequelae and the impact of Homoeopathy were conducted. For the literature search, the major electronic bio-medical database PubMed/MEDLINE was used. In addition, supplementary searches were conducted through the references of those published articles. SUMMARY: A total of 113 records were identified of which 61 studies included for this review. Homoeopathy is effective in the treatment of mental disorders including anxiety and depressive disorder (ADD), some research studies have found, although systematic reviews disagree. Likewise, some medical societies denounce homoeopathy for pain management; other literature shows that it can be used to treat pain effectively. Homoeopathy can aid in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, as Crataegus, a homoeopathic medication, was found to be just as effective as a standard angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and diuretic treatment for minor cardiac insufficiency. The outcomes for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), Influenza, and Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (ARTIs) are also promising. OUTLOOK: Based on the results of homoeopathy in non-COVID conditions, it can be thought of in the management of post-COVID-19 outcomes. Consequently, we propose that while investigating post-COVID-19 patient rehabilitation, homoeopathic management may be included as part of the follow-up route and as much data as possible in the context of homoeopathy should be collected, so that in future, the role of homoeopathy in dealing with it can be better demonstrated.",

A better understanding of these conditions will lead to tailored support and resources for nursing staff during and after the pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Hospital nurses and nursing assistants (N\u00a0=\u00a0587) were recruited online between May-June 2020. The survey included measures on insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) fatigue and intershift recovery (Occupational Fatigue and Exhaustion Recovery-15), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey), post-traumatic stress (Short Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Rating Interview) and psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), and questions on work and demographics. The STROBE checklist was followed for reporting. RESULTS: The sample had subthreshold insomnia, moderate-to-high chronic fatigue, high acute fatigue and low-to-moderate intershift recovery. The sample experienced increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation, increased personal accomplishment, moderate psychological distress and high post-traumatic stress. Nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients had significantly scored worse on almost all measures than their co-workers. Certain factors such as working hours per week and the frequency of 30-min breaks were significant. CONCLUSION: Nursing staff experienced poor sleep, fatigue and multiple psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, staff who were involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, worked more than 40\u00a0h per week and skipped 30-min breaks showed generally worse self-reported outcomes. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nursing administration is recommended to monitor for fatigue and distress on nursing units, re-visit current scheduling practices, reinforce rest breaks and provide access to mental health and sleep wellness resources with additional support for their front-line nursing groups.",

This study evaluated the sleep habits of pilots and copilots flying short-haul flights in the Gulf region. Methods This cross-sectional study examined Airbus A320 pilots and copilots for one of Saudi Arabia's commercial airlines. Data such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), employment position, work experience, flight hours, and rest time were collected. Each participant completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for daytime sleepiness, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Fatigue Severity Index (FSI). Actigraphy equipment was used to perform objective sleep evaluations. Results Twenty-four participants were included. Actigraphy showed that 66.7% had an irregular sleep pattern and that 41.7% had poor sleep efficiency. We found that 12.5% had daytime sleepiness, 33% had poor sleep quality, and 29.2% had fatigue. We found a significant negative correlation between years of experience and time in bed; however, there was no significant difference in sleep time or sleep efficiency between pilots with different levels of experience. Conclusions We found that pilots and copilots are at risk of irregular sleep patterns, poor sleep efficiency, poor sleep quality, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue.

We specifically probe perceived commonalities and departures in experience between government- and health-imposed lockdowns, application of coping strategies for social isolation, and predictions for inclusion of the chronically ill in post-pandemic society. METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted in pwME/CFS between June - July, 2020. Responses were qualitatively analysed using an experiential, thematic framework. RESULTS: While participants reported enhancements in digital accessibility during lockdown, they perceived this as an unintentional benefit from changes designed to cater universally. Similarly, their expectation was that the general population's limited experience of restriction would not engender greater understanding for those who would continue to experience health-imposed lockdowns, post-pandemic. Participants described numerous strategies for coping with restriction and isolation, developed during prior health-imposed lockdowns and applied to this novel circumstance, highlighting the presence of acceptance and resilience in the sample.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nurses' effective handover communication is vital for patient safety and quality of care. Few studies have empirically tested how certain factors influence the quality of handover in the Saudi context. METHODS: A descriptive correlational design was used with a convenience sample of all nurses (N\u2009=\u2009201) working in Saudi hospital CCUs in 2022. Demographics and handover quality instruments were used to collect the necessary data in addition to two open-ended questions that asked about perceived barriers and facilitators to handover. The analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and regression analysis. RESULTS: The majority of nurses reported good-quality handover. The regression analysis showed that staffing, cognitive capacity, the focus of attention, relationships, and safety climate factors contributed positively to the variance of handover quality. In contrast, intrusions, distractions, anxiety, time stress, and acute and chronic fatigue factors negatively affected the prediction of handover quality (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Nurses added types of shifts and languages as barriers to handover while emphasizing training and the use of standardized tools for handover as facilitators. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Nursing handover is a multidimensional phenomenon. By understanding the determinants that contribute to or hinder handover quality, it is possible to develop targeted interventions aimed at improving communication and the quality of shift handover in CCUs. The current study's findings highlight the need for nurses to work in a more supportive environment, receive better training, and follow a standardized handover protocol. Additionally, nurse managers should pay more attention to nurses' well-being to control or mitigate the effect of psychological precursors on the quality of nurses' handover. Future research should investigate handover practices and outcomes on units that have both good and bad practice environments.",

        "abstract": "Chronic fatigue is a frequent complaint, expressed at all levels of the healthcare system. It is perceived as disabling in a high proportion of cases, and internists are frequently called upon to find \"the\" cause. The etiological diagnostic approach of an unexplained state of fatigue relies on the careful search for more specific clues by questioning and clinical examination. It is necessary to recognize the limited place of complementary examinations apart from the basic biological parameters. Simple rating scales can be useful in the etiological and differential diagnosis of fatigue. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), in the current state of knowledge, cannot be considered as a specific pathological entity distinct from idiopathic chronic fatigue states, and does not have validated biomarkers. It is important to know that a state of chronic asthenia often results from several intricated etiological factors (biological, psychological and social), to be classified as predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating. The metabolic and cardiorespiratory exercise test has a major place in the assessment and management of fatigue, as a prerequisite for personalized retraining or adapted physical activity (APA), which are the treatments of choice for chronic fatigue.",

Abnormal intestinal bacterial profiles and low bacterial diversity appear to play important roles in the pathophysiology of IBS. This narrative review was designed to present recent observations made relating to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which implicate possible roles of 11 intestinal bacteria in the pathophysiology of IBS. The intestinal abundances of nine of these bacteria increased after FMT in patients with IBS, and these increases were inversely correlated with IBS symptoms and fatigue severity. These bacteria were Alistipes spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium biforme, Holdemanella biformis, Prevotella spp., Bacteroides stercoris, Parabacteroides johnsonii, Bacteroides zoogleoformans, and Lactobacillus spp. The intestinal abundances of two bacteria were decreased in patients with IBS after FMT and were correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms and fatigue (Streptococcus thermophilus and Coprobacillus cateniformis). Ten of these bacteria are anaerobic and one (Streptococcus thermophilus) is facultative anaerobic. Several of these bacteria produce short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which is used as an energy source by large intestine epithelial cells. Moreover, it modulates the immune response and hypersensitivity of the large intestine and decreases intestinal cell permeability and intestinal motility. These bacteria could be used as probiotics to improve these conditions. Protein-rich diets could increase the intestinal abundance of Alistipes, and plant-rich diet could increase the intestinal abundance of Prevotella spp., and consequently improve IBS and fatigue.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Neurological manifestations are frequent after acquiring COVID-19 and may persist long-term as part of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Cognitive impairment, chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, and headache complaints are the most reported neurological features. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers were particularly vulnerable due to the high workload and levels of stress associated with this period, but acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may also contribute. The authors aimed to evaluate the neurological involvement of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 in a population of hospital health care workers and its impact on their personal and professional lives. Methods A sample of health care workers who did and did not acquire SARS-CoV-2 matched by age and sociodemographic variables was studied. Through an online questionnaire, data were collected regarding the symptoms in the acute phase of the disease (for those who acquired it) and for all in the last 6 months of the study period. Proportion of neurological complaints were compared between groups, adjusting for age, sex, and professional class (using a rate ratio (RR)). Results This study included 326 participants (174 cases and 152 controls). The mean age (standard deviation) was 39.7 (10.2) years, and the female:male ratio was 3:1. Headache and cognitive complaints were the most prevalent neurological complaints in the last 6 months of the study period. The health care workers who acquired SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to report headache and cognitive complaints than the control group (RR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.9 and RR = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.53-2.65, respectively).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Free-water-corrected diffusion tensor imaging (FW-DTI), a new analysis method for diffusion MRI, can indicate neuroinflammation and degeneration. There is increasing evidence of autoimmune etiology in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We used FW-DTI and conventional DTI to investigate microstructural brain changes related to autoantibody titers in patients with ME/CFS. METHODS: We prospectively examined 58 consecutive right-handed ME/CFS patients who underwent both brain MRI including FW-DTI and a blood analysis of autoantibody titers against \u03b21 adrenergic receptor (\u03b21 AdR-Ab), \u03b22 AdR-Ab, M3 acetylcholine receptor (M3 AchR-Ab), and M4 AchR-Ab. We investigated the correlations between these four autoantibody titers and three FW-DTI indices-free water (FW), FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAt), and FW-corrected mean diffusivity-as well as two conventional DTI indices-fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity. The patients' age and gender were considered as nuisance covariates. We also evaluated the correlations between the FW-DTI indices and the performance status and disease duration. RESULTS: Significant negative correlations between the serum levels of several autoantibody titers and DTI indices were identified, mainly in the right frontal operculum. The disease duration showed significant negative correlations with both FAt and FA in the right frontal operculum. The changes in the FW-corrected DTI indices were observed over a wider extent compared to the conventional DTI indices. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the value of using DTI to assess the microstructure of ME/CFS. The abnormalities of right frontal operculum may be a diagnostic marker for ME/CFS.",

The causes of these syndromes and the reason for their frequent association are not yet fully understood. We previously published a comprehensive hypothesis of the ME/CFS pathophysiology that explains the majority of symptoms, findings and chronicity of the disease. We wondered whether some of the identified key pathomechanisms in ME/CFS are also operative in MCA, endometriosis and dysmenorrhea, POTS, decreased cerebral blood flow and SFN, and possibly may provide clues on their causes and frequent co-occurrence. Our analysis indeed provides strong arguments in favor of this assumption, and we conclude that the main pathomechanisms responsible for this association are excessive generation and spillover into the systemic circulation of inflammatory and vasoactive tissue mediators, dysfunctional \u03b22AdR, and the mutual triggering of symptomatology and disease initiation. Overall, vascular dysfunction appears to be a strong common denominator in these linkages.",

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystem chronic illness characterized by severe muscle fatigue, pain, dizziness, and brain fog. Many patients with ME/CFS experience orthostatic intolerance (OI), which is characterized by frequent dizziness, light-headedness, and feeling faint while maintaining an upright posture. Despite intense investigation, the molecular mechanism of this debilitating condition is still unknown. OI is often manifested by cardiovascular alterations, such as reduced cerebral blood flow, reduced blood pressure, and diminished heart rate. The bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzyme, is tightly coupled with cardiovascular health and circulation. To explore the role of BH4 in ME/CFS, serum samples of CFS patients (n = 32), CFS patients with OI only (n = 10; CFS + OI), and CFS patients with both OI and small fiber polyneuropathy (n = 12; CFS + OI + SFN) were subjected to BH4 ELISA. Interestingly, our results revealed that the BH4 expression is significantly high in CFS, CFS + OI, and CFS + OI + SFN patients compared to age-/gender-matched controls. Finally, a ROS production assay in cultured microglial cells followed by Pearson correlation statistics indicated that the elevated BH4 in serum samples of CFS + OI patients might be associated with the oxidative stress response. These findings suggest that the regulation of BH4 metabolism could be a promising target for understanding the molecular mechanism of CFS and CFS with OI.",

This study recruited 90 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in an acute phase, of whom 71 showed a first-episode MDD (FEM), and 40 controls. We constructed RADAR scores for ACE; NLE encountered in the last year; SB; and severity of depression, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and physiosomatic symptoms using the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales and the FibroFatigue scale. The partial least squares analysis showed that in FEM, one latent vector (labeled the phenome of FEM) could be extracted from depressive, anxiety, fatigue, physiosomatic, melancholia, and insomnia symptoms, SB, and cognitive impairments. The latter were conceptualized as a latent vector extracted from the Verbal Fluency Test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and ratings of memory and judgement, indicating a generalized cognitive decline (G-CoDe). We found that 60.8% of the variance in the FEM phenome was explained by the cumulative effects of NLE and ACE, in particular emotional neglect and, to a lesser extent, physical abuse. In conclusion, the RADAR scores and plots constructed here should be used in research and clinical settings, rather than the binary diagnosis of MDD based on the DSM-5 or ICD.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A central feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is post exertional malaise (PEM), which is an acute worsening of symptoms after a physical, emotional and/or mental exertion. PEM is also a feature of Long COVID. Dynamic measures of PEM have historically included scaled questionnaires which have not been validated in ME/CFS. To enhance our understanding of PEM and how best to measure it, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews (QIs) at the same intervals as Visual Analog Scale (VAS) measures after a Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET). METHODS: Ten ME/CFS and nine healthy volunteers participated in a CPET. For each participant, PEM symptom VAS (7 symptoms) and semi-structured QIs were administered at six timepoints over 72 hours before and after a single CPET. QI data were used to plot the severity of PEM at each time point and identify the self-described most bothersome symptom for each patient. QI data were used to determine the symptom trajectory and peak of PEM. Performance of QI and VAS data were compared to each other using Spearman correlations. RESULTS: QIs documented that each ME/CFS volunteer had a unique PEM experience, with differences noted in the onset, severity, trajectory over time, and most bothersome symptom. No healthy volunteers experienced PEM. Scaled QI data were able to identify PEM peaks and trajectories, even when VAS scales were unable to do so due to known ceiling and floor effects. QI and VAS fatigue data corresponded well prior to exercise (baseline, r=0.7) but poorly at peak PEM (r=0.28) and with the change from baseline to peak (r=0.20). When the most bothersome symptom identified from QIs was used, these correlations improved (r=.0.77, 0.42. and 0.54 respectively) and reduced the observed VAS scale ceiling and floor effects. CONCLUSION: QIs were able to capture changes in PEM severity and symptom quality over time in all the ME/CFS volunteers, even when VAS scales failed to do so. Information collected from QIs also improved the performance of VAS. Measurement of PEM can be improved by using a quantitative-qualitative mixed model approach.

METHODS: Forty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into normal group (10 rats) and modeling group (30 rats); then after modeling, they were selected and randomly divided into model group (10 rats) and TEAS group (10 rats). CFS rats model was prepared by sleep deprivation combined with weight-bearing swimming. Rats in the TEAS group were stimulated with Han's acupoint nerve stimulator at bilateral \"Zusanli\" (ST36) and \"Shenshu\" (BL23) (2 Hz/15 Hz, 1-2 mA), 20 min each time, once a day for 4 weeks with 1 d rest every 6 d.

RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the score of general condition was increased (P<0.01); the escape latency was prolonged (P<0.05, P<0.01) and the times of crossing the original platform was decreased (P<0.05); the expression levels of ERK, CREB and BDNF mRNAs and proteins in hippocampus were decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01) in the model group. Compared with the model group, the scores of general condition on the 42nd and 49th day were decreased (P<0.05, P<0.01); the escape latency was shortened (P<0.01, P<0.05)and the times of crossing the original platform were increased (P<0.05); the expression levels of ERK, CREB and BDNF mRNAs and proteins in hippocampus were increased (P<0.01, P<0.05) in the TEAS group. The morphology of neurons in hippocampal CA1 region was normal in the normal group. In the model group, the number of neurons in hippocampal CA1 region decreased, the arrangement of nerve cells was scattered, the number of apoptotic cells increased, some nuclear structures disappeared, nuclear heterochromatin increased, the cell membrane wrinkled, the chromatin appeared empty bright area, and the crista was incomplete. Compared with the model group, the nerve cells morphology in hippocampal CA1 region was more regular, the number of apoptotic cells decreased, the chromatin and the cytoplasm were uniformly distributed, and the crista was relatively intact in the TEAS group. CONCLUSION: TEAS can improve the learning and memory ability of CFS rats, the mechanisms may be related to improving the neural structure of hippocampal CA1 region and up-regulating the expression levels of ERK/CREB/BDNF.",

        "abstract": "Many skeletal muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and sarcopenia share the dysregulation of calcium (Ca2+) as a key mechanism of disease at a cellular level. Cytosolic concentrations of Ca2+ can signal dysregulation in organelles including the mitochondria, nucleus, and sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. In this work, a treatment is applied to mimic the Ca2+ increase associated with these atrophy-related disease states, and broadband impedance measurements are taken for single cells with and without this treatment using a microfluidic device. The resulting impedance measurements are fitted using a single-shell circuit simulation to show calculated electrical dielectric property contributions based on these Ca2+ changes. From this, similar distributions were seen in the Ca2+ from fluorescence measurements and the distribution of the S-parameter at a single frequency, identifying Ca2+ as the main contributor to the electrical differences being identified. Extracted dielectric parameters also showed different distribution patterns between the untreated and ionomycin-treated groups; however, the overall electrical parameters suggest the impact of Ca2+-induced changes at a wider range of frequencies.",

METHODS: Sixty-four patients with CFS were randomly divided into a moxibustion group (32 cases, 1 case dropped off, 1 case excluded) and an acupuncture group (32 cases, 2 cases dropped off). The patients in the moxibustion group were treated with bamboo-based medicinal moxibustion, while the patients in the acupuncture group were treated with routine acupuncture. Both groups were treated once a day, 6 days as a course of treatment with 1 day interval, for a total of 2 courses of treatment. Before treatment, 1 and 2 courses into treatment and in the follow-up of 14 days after treatment, the fatigue scale-14 (FS-14) and somatic and psychological health report (SPHERE) scores were observed in the two groups. Before and after treatment, the contents of CD+3, CD+4, CD+8 of peripheral blood T lymphocyte subsets were measured and CD+4/CD+8 ratio was calculated; the clinical efficacy of the two groups was compared. RESULTS: Compared before treatment, the FS-14 and SPHERE scores in the two groups were decreased 1 and 2 courses into treatment and in the follow-up (P<0.01), and the FS-14 and SPHERE scores in the moxibustion group were lower than those in the acupuncture group (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared before treatment, the contents of CD+3, CD+4 and CD+4/CD+8 ratio in the moxibustion group were increased after treatment (P<0.01). There was no significant difference of CD+3, CD+4, CD+8 and CD+4/CD+8 ratio between before and after treatment in the acupuncture group (P>0.05). After treatment, the contents of CD+3 and CD+4 in the moxibustion group were higher than those in the acupuncture group (P<0.05). The total effective rate was 93.3% (28/30) in the moxibustion group, which was higher than 73.3% (22/30) in the acupuncture group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Bamboo-based medicinal moxibustion could improve the physical and mental fatigue symptoms and psychological status in patients with CFS.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severe fatigue following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is prevalent and debilitating. This study investigated the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for severe fatigue following COVID-19. METHODS: A multicenter, 2-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands with patients being severely fatigued 3-12 months following COVID-19. Patients (N = 114) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT or care as usual (CAU). CBT, targeting perpetuating factors of fatigue, was provided for 17 weeks. The primary outcome was the overall mean difference between CBT and CAU on the fatigue severity subscale of the Checklist Individual Strength, directly post-CBT or CAU (T1), and after 6 months (T2). Secondary outcomes were differences in proportions of patients meeting criteria for severe and/or chronic fatigue, differences in physical and social functioning, somatic symptoms, and problems concentrating between CBT and CAU. RESULTS: Patients were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred. Patients who received CBT were significantly less severely fatigued across follow-up assessments than patients receiving CAU (-8.8 [95% confidence interval {CI}, -11.9 to -5.8]); P < .001), representing a medium Cohen's d effect size (0.69). The between-group difference in fatigue severity was present at T1 (-9.3 [95% CI, -13.3 to -5.3]) and T2 (-8.4 [95% CI, -13.1 to -3.7]). All secondary outcomes favored CBT. Eight adverse events were recorded during CBT, and 20 during CAU. No serious adverse events were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients, who were mainly nonhospitalized and self-referred, CBT was effective in reducing fatigue. The positive effect was sustained at 6-month follow-up.

In pathogenesis, the induction of autoantibodies (AAB) against G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), such as \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-AdR), has been suspected. GPCR-AAB correlate with symptom severity and autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS. Objectives: To describe symptoms and treatment of a patient presenting with infection-triggered ME/CFS demonstrating that levels of \u03b2-AdR-AAB underlie modulation over time, correlating with the severity of symptoms. METHODS: At T1 and T2, GPCR-AAB were measured and questionnaires assessing symptom severity were completed. TSHDS-IgM-AAB were tested, and SF density was analyzed via skin probe. RESULTS: At T2, elevated levels of \u03b2-AdR-AAB were found, corresponding with an aggravation of fatigue and pain symptoms. Elevated TSHDS-IgM-AAB were found, which corresponded with reduced fiber density from the skin probe. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of \u03b2-AdR-AAB in post-infectious ME/CFS can be modulated.

Nutrition and chronobiology are often overlooked in multicomponent approach despite their potential. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary group intervention based on nutrition, chronobiology, and physical exercise in the improvement of lifestyle and quality of life in FM and CFS. METHODS: Mixed-methods study based on a randomized clinical trial and qualitative analysis with a descriptive phenomenological approach. The study will be conducted in primary care in Catalonia. The control group will follow the usual clinical practice and the intervention group the usual practice plus the studied intervention (12 hours over 4 days). The intervention based on nutrition, chronobiology and physical exercise will be designed considering participants' opinions as collected in 4 focus groups. To evaluate effectiveness, EuroQol-5D, multidimensional fatigue inventory, VAS pain, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, erMEDAS-17, biological rhythms interview of assessment in neuropsychiatry, REGICOR-Short, FIQR and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires will be collected at baseline, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Food intake, body composition, resistance and, strength will also be evaluated. The effect size will be calculated using Cohen d and logistic regression models will be used to quantify the impact of the intervention by adjusting for different variables. DISCUSSION: It expected that the intervention will improve the patients' quality of life, fatigue, pain and insomnia, as well as food and physical exercise habits, providing effectiveness evidence of a new therapy in addressing these syndromes in Primary Heath Care. Improvements in the quality of life will have a positive socioeconomic impact by reducing health expenditure on recurrent medical consultation, medication, complementary medical tests, etc and favor the maintenance of an active working life and productivity.",

Although the disease has been known for a long time, and has been coded in the ICD since 1969 (G93.3), medical research has not yet been able to reach a consensus regarding its physiological basis and how best to treat it. Against the background of these shortcomings, psychosomatic disease models have been developed and psychotherapeutic treatments have been derived from them, but their empirical testing has led to sobering results. According to the current state of research, psychotherapy and psychosomatic rehabilitation have no curative effect in the treatment of ME/CFS. Nevertheless, we see numerous patients in practices and outpatient clinics who suffer severely as a result of their illness and whose mental well-being and coping strategies would benefit from psychotherapeutic help. In this article, we outline a psychotherapeutic approach that serves this need, taking into account two basic characteristics of ME/CFS: firstly, the fact that ME/CFS is a physical illness and that curative treatment must therefore be physical; and secondly, the fact that post exertional malaise (PEM) is a cardinal symptom of ME/CFS and thus warrants tailored psychotherapeutic attention.",

The mechanistic underpinnings of such symptoms are poorly understood. REVIEW FINDINGS: Early studies suggest deconditioning as the primary explanation for exertional intolerance in PASC. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing reveals perturbations related to systemic blood flow and ventilatory control associated with acute exercise intolerance in PASC, which are not typical of simple detraining.

Chronic fatigue lasting more than three months is the major symptom of the post-COVID syndrome (known colloquially as long-COVID). The mechanisms underlying long-COVID fatigue are unknown. We hypothesized that the development of long-COVID chronic fatigue is driven by the pro-inflammatory immune status of an individual prior to COVID-19. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We analyzed pre-pandemic plasma levels of IL-6, which plays a key role in persistent fatigue, in N\u2009=\u20091274 community dwelling adults from TwinsUK. Subsequent COVID-19-positive and -negative participants were categorized based on SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody testing. Chronic fatigue was assessed using the Chalder Fatigue Scale. RESULTS: COVID-19-positive participants exhibited mild disease. Chronic fatigue was a prevalent symptom among this population and significantly higher in positive vs. negative participants (17% vs 11%, respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.001). The qualitative nature of chronic fatigue as determined by individual questionnaire responses was similar in positive and negative participants. Pre-pandemic plasma IL-6 levels were positively associated with chronic fatigue in negative, but not positive individuals. Raised BMI was associated with chronic fatigue in positive participants. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing increased IL-6 levels may contribute to chronic fatigue symptoms, but there was no increased risk in individuals with mild COVID-19 compared with uninfected individuals.

Previous investigations in other CMI populations (i.e., Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) have reported associations between PEM and expression of genes coding for adrenergic, metabolic, and immune function. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether PEM is meditated by gene expression in Veterans with GWI. METHODS: Veterans with GWI (n\u00a0=\u00a037) and healthy control Gulf War Veterans (n\u00a0=\u00a025) provided blood samples before and after 30-min of cycling at 70% of age-predicted heart rate reserve. Relative quantification of gene expression, symptom measurements, and select cardiopulmonary parameters were compared between groups at pre-, 30 minpost-, and 24 hpost-exercise using a doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-MANOVA). Mediation analyses were used to test indirect effects of changes in gene expression on symptom responses (i.e., PEM) to the standardized exercise challenge. RESULTS: Veterans with GWI experienced large symptom exacerbations following exercise compared to controls (Cohen's d: 1.65; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

        "abstract": "Large-scale epidemiological studies suggest that veterans may have poorer physical health than nonveterans, but this has been largely unexamined in post-9/11 veterans despite research indicating their high levels of disability and healthcare utilization. Additionally, little investigation has been conducted on sex-based differences and interactions by veteran status. Notably, few studies have explored veteran physical health in relation to national health guidelines. Self-reported, weighted data were analyzed on post-9/11 U.S. veterans and nonveterans (n\u00a0=\u00a019,693; 6,992 women, 12,701 men; 15,160 veterans, 4,533 nonveterans). Prevalence was estimated for 24 physical health conditions classified by Healthy People 2020 targeted topic areas. Associations between physical health outcomes and veteran status were evaluated using bivariable and multivariable analyses. Back/neck pain was most reported by veterans (49.3\u00a0%), twice that of nonveterans (22.8\u00a0%)(p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) for musculoskeletal and hearing disorders, traumatic brain injury, and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were 3-6 times higher in veterans versus nonveterans (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women versus men had the greatest adjusted odds for bladder infections (males:females, AOR\u00a0=\u00a00.08, 95\u00a0% CI:0.04-0.18)(p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and greater odds than men for multiple sclerosis, CFS, cancer, irritable bowel syndrome/colitis, respiratory disease, some musculoskeletal disorders, and vision loss (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Cardiovascular-related conditions were most prominent for men (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Veteran status by sex interactions were found for obesity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.03; greater for male veterans) and migraine (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; greater for females).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a highly prevalent and debilitating symptom among patients in the chronic phase of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) with no identified effective treatment. Cognitive therapy has been shown to have moderate effects on fatigue. Delineating the coping strategies used by patients with post-aSAH fatigue and relating them to fatigue severity and emotional symptoms could be a step towards developing a behavioural therapy for post-aSAH fatigue. METHODS: Ninety-six good outcome patients with chronic post-aSAH fatigue answered the questionnaires Brief COPE, (a questionnaire defining 14 coping strategies and three Coping Styles), the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Mental Fatigue Scale (MFS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The Brief COPE scores were compared with fatigue severity and emotional symptoms of the patients. RESULTS: The prevailing coping strategies were \"Acceptance\", \"Emotional Support\", \"Active Coping\" and \"Planning\". \"Acceptance\" was the sole coping strategy that was significantly inversely related to levels of fatigue. Patients with the highest scores for mental fatigue and those with clinically significant emotional symptoms applied significantly more maladaptive avoidant strategies. Females and the youngest patients applied more \"Problem-Focused\" strategies. CONCLUSION: A therapeutic behavioural model aiming at furthering \"Acceptance\" and reducing passivity and \"Avoidant\" strategies may contribute to alleviate post-aSAH fatigue in good outcome patients. Given the chronic nature of post-aSAH fatigue, neurosurgeons may encourage patients to accept their new situation so that they can start a process of positive reframing instead of being trapped in a spiral of futile loss of energy and secondary increased emotional burden and frustration.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persistent fatigue is a common complaint in ANCA-vasculitis (AAV) patients and has a profound impact on patient's quality of life. The symptoms associated with this fatigue mirror those found in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia. Etiologic and pathophysiologic differences exist between PR3- and MPO-ANCA disease, yet differences in their fatigue manifestations have not been well researched. We compared fatigue and its associations in healthy controls, AAV patients and fibromyalgia controls. METHODS: The Canadian consensus criteria were used for ME/CFS diagnosis, and American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia diagnosis. Factors such as cognitive failure, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances were assessed by patient reported questionnaires. Clinical factors such as BVAS, vasculitis damage index, CRP and BMI were also collected. FINDINGS: Our AAV cohort comprised 52 patients, with a mean age of 44.7 (20-79), 57% (30/52) of the patients were female. We found 51.9% (27/52) of patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, with 37% (10/27) of those having comorbid fibromyalgia. Rates of fatigue were higher in MPO-ANCA patients, than in PR3-ANCA patients, and their symptoms were more similar to the fibromyalgia controls. Fatigue in PR3-ANCA patients was related to inflammatory markers. These differences may be due to the varied pathophysiology of the PR3- and MPO-ANCA serotypes. INTERPRETATION: A large proportion of AAV patients suffer from debilitating fatigue consequential enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Fatigue associations were not the same between PR3- and MPO-ANCA patients, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be different. Future studies should consider ANCA serotype, as further research may inform different clinical treatment strategies for AAV patients suffering from ME/CFS.

The prevalence of comorbid conditions and their impact on IBS symptom severity and quality of life in rural community populations has not been described. METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey to patients with a documented CSS diagnosis in rural primary care practices to evaluate the relationship between CSS diagnoses, quality of life, symptom severity, and interactions with healthcare providers utilizing validated questionnaires. Subgroup analysis was performed on the IBS cohort. Mayo Clinic IRB approved the study. KEY RESULTS: Seven hundred seventy-five individuals out of 5000 completed the survey (15.5% response rate) with 264 (34%) reporting IBS. Only 3% (n\u00a0=\u20098) of IBS patients reported IBS alone without comorbid CSS condition. Most respondents reported overlapping migraine (196, 74%), depression (183, 69%), anxiety (171, 64%), and fibromyalgia (139, 52%). IBS patients with more than two comorbid CS condition showed significantly higher symptom severity with linear increase. Quality of life was lower in IBS with comorbid conditions, particularly in patients with IBS and RLS (mean EQ5-D 0.36 vs. 0.8 in IBS only, p\u00a0<\u20090.01). Quality of life declined as number of comorbid conditions increased. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Patients with IBS often have multiple CS disorders which increases symptom severity and lowers quality of life.

Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (I-CBT) is a promising treatment for severe fatigue among adolescents with a chronic medical condition, but its effectiveness has not been studied. AIMS: We developed an I-CBT intervention for disabling fatigue in a chronic medical condition and tested its feasibility and effectiveness in an adolescent with an immune dysregulation disorder (IDD), namely juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHOD: The application of I-CBT is illustrated through a clinical case study of a 15-year-old girl with JIA and chronic severe fatigue. An A-B single case experimental design was used with randomization of the waiting period prior to start of the intervention. Outcomes were weekly measures of fatigue severity, physical functioning, school absence and pain severity. RESULTS: Fatigue severity significantly decreased following I-CBT. Improvements were observed towards increased school attendance and improved physical functioning following the intervention, but these effects were too small to become significant. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides preliminary support for the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of I-CBT for severe fatigue in adolescents with a long-term medical condition.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue is a significant symptom in several diseases including traumatic and degenerative neurological disorders. While several studies have investigated the correlates of chronic fatigue, there is as yet no unifying framework to explain chronic fatigue. METHODS: In this narrative review, I investigate the role of selective attention in the development of chronic fatigue and discuss results within the framework of the sensory attenuation model of fatigue, which posits that fatigue is the phenomenological output of altered attention to sensory input. Following a short introduction of this framework, I present results from investigations that address attentional mechanisms in fatigue in multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and Parkinson's disease. RESULTS: Attention was quantified in all four disease models using a variety of outcome measures, including behavioural, neurophysiological, structural and functional brain connectivity. The range of measures precluded direct comparison of results across disease conditions; however, in all four disease models there was evidence of poor selective attention that explained levels of chronic fatigue, supporting the sensory attenuation model of fatigue as a disease-independent mechanism of fatigue. Evidence was lacking to draw any conclusions about the direction of causality. CONCLUSION: The role of selective attention in development of fatigue is indicated. Future studies must focus on establishing causality and exploring attentional circuitry as a potential therapeutic target.",

        "abstract": "Gulf War Illness (GWI) has been reported in 25%-35% of veterans returned from the Gulf war. Symptoms of GWI are varied and include both neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as chronic fatigue. Development of GWI has been associated with chemical exposure particularly with exposure to pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and permethrin. Recent studies have found that the pathology of GWI is connected to changes in the gut microbiota, that is the gut dysbiosis. In studies using animal models, the exposure to PB and permethrin resulted in similar changes in the gut microbiome as these found in GW veterans with GWI. Studies using animal models have also shown that phytochemicals like curcumin are beneficial in reducing the symptoms and that the extracellular vesicles (EV) released from gut bacteria and from the intestinal epithelium can both promote diseases and suppress diseases through the intercellular communication mechanisms. The intestinal epithelium cells produce EVs and these EVs of intestinal epithelium origin are found to suppress inflammatory bowel disease severity, suggesting the benefits of utilizing EV in treatments. On the contrary, EV from the plasma of septic mice enhanced the level of proinflammatory cytokines in vitro and neutrophils and macrophages in vivo, suggesting differences in the EV depending on the types of cells they were originated and/or influences of environmental changes. These studies suggest that targeting the EV that specifically have positive influences may become a new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of veterans with GWI.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms can worsen or maintain the severity of symptoms across long-term conditions (LTCs). Although the Cognitive and Behavioural Responses Questionnaire (CBRQ) has been used in research, its original development and psychometric properties as a transdiagnostic measure have not been reported. Our aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the CBRQ and a recently proposed short version, across different LTCs. DESIGN: Psychometric validation study. METHODS: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested the factor structure of the CBRQ in two datasets from the CBRQ's original development; (chronic fatigue syndrome, N\u00a0=\u00a0230; and multiple sclerosis, N\u00a0=\u00a0221) and in additional groups: haemodialysis (N\u00a0=\u00a0174), inflammatory bowel disease (N\u00a0=\u00a0182) and chronic dizziness (N\u00a0=\u00a0185). Scale reliability and construct validity were assessed. The factor structure of the shortened CBRQ (CBRQ-SF) was also assessed. RESULTS: CFA revealed that a 7-or 8-factor structure had generally appropriate fit supporting the originally proposed 7 factors (Fear avoidance, Damage beliefs, Catastrophising, Embarrassment avoidance, Symptom focusing, All-or-nothing behaviour and Avoidance/Resting behaviour). Omega coefficients indicated satisfactory internal reliability. Correlations with related constructs suggested construct validity. The scale appeared sensitive to change. The CBRQ-SF also displayed good psychometric quality, with a better model fit than the CBRQ. CONCLUSIONS: The CBRQ and the shortened version were shown to be reliable and valid at assessing a range of cognitive and behavioural responses to symptoms, highlighting the multi-symptom, transdiagnostic properties of this questionnaire. Further research is necessary to determine the test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change of the CBRQ and CBRQ-SF and a thorough evaluation of the content validity of the items.",

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study comparing adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease-positive [COVID+]) with adults who tested negative (COVID-), enrolled within 28 days of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SARS-CoV-2 test result for active symptoms. Sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (assessed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Person Under Investigation Symptom List), and symptoms of post-infectious syndromes (ie, fatigue, sleep quality, muscle/joint pains, unrefreshing sleep, and dizziness/fainting, assessed with CDC Short Symptom Screener for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) were assessed at baseline and 3 months via electronic surveys sent via text or email. RESULTS: Among the first 1000 participants, 722 were COVID+ and 278 were COVID-. Mean age was 41.5 (SD 15.2); 66.3% were female, 13.4% were Black, and 15.3% were Hispanic. At baseline, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were more common in the COVID+ group than the COVID- group. At 3 months, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms declined in both groups, although were more prevalent in the COVID+ group: upper respiratory symptoms/head/eyes/ears/nose/throat (HEENT; 37.3% vs 20.9%), constitutional (28.8% vs 19.4%), musculoskeletal (19.5% vs 14.7%), pulmonary (17.6% vs 12.2%), cardiovascular (10.0% vs 7.2%), and gastrointestinal (8.7% vs 8.3%); only 50.2% and 73.3% reported no symptoms at all. Symptoms of post-infectious syndromes were similarly prevalent among the COVID+ and COVID- groups at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half of COVID+ participants, as compared with one-quarter of COVID- participants, had at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 symptom at 3 months, highlighting the need for future work to distinguish long COVID.

        "abstract": "Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with unknown pathophysiology. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in ME/CFS have reported disparate connectivities for the brain salience (SA) network and default mode network (DMN). Materials and Methods: In this study, we acquired resting-state and task fMRI with an advanced scanner for improved subject numbers: 24 healthy controls (HC) and 42 ME/CFS patients, 18 meeting the International Consensus Criteria (ICC) and 24 meeting the Fukuda criteria. We evaluated mean functional connectivity between the SA network and DMN hubs and subcortical regions known to be involved in ME/CFS. We tested the hypothesis that ME/CFS connectivity differed from HC and the ICC and Fukuda classes are distinguished by different connectivities with HC for different pairs of SA network, DMN, or subcortical hubs. Results: During resting-state fMRI, only two connections differed from HC, both for Fukuda ME/CFS and both with an SA network hub. During task fMRI, 10 ME/CFS connections differed from HC, 5 for ICC, and 5 for Fukuda. None was common to both classes. Eight of the 10 different connections involved an SA network hub, six of the 10 were weaker in ME/CFS, and 4 were stronger. SA network connections to the hippocampus and brainstem reticular activation system (RAS) differed from and were stronger than HC. Conclusions: The SA network mediates the relative activity of the DMN and executive networks and an imbalance will have functional consequences. The RAS and hippocampus modulate cortical activation. Different regulatory connections are consistent with the impaired cognitive performance and sleep-wake cycle of ME/CFS. Different neuropathologies are involved in ICC and Fukuda classes. Impact statement Criteria for the diagnosis of the debilitating myalgic encephalitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) condition have evolved over two decades. Physicians are now instructed that the recent, more stringent (ICC) questionnaire criteria define a disease that is distinct from those remaining subjects defined by the previous Fukuda criteria. This work reports the remarkable finding that functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity can differentiate between these two classes of ME/CFS. This is the first objective medical evidence that the questionnaire-based diagnosis does indeed differentiate between two different disease states. This facilitates a clearer understanding of ME/CFS and can better direct research and therapy development.",

Monitoring nursing performance as well as fatigue is important for appropriate safety management of patients and nurses, and the development of a monitoring tool is essential. The Nursing Performance Instrument (NPI) can provide comprehensive and brief monitoring of nursing performance. This study aimed to verify the validity and reliability of a Japanese version of the NPI (NPI-J). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on nurses who work in inpatient care across five Japanese hospitals. We considered appropriate factor numbers with parallel analysis and the Velicer's minimum average partial test. The construct validity was evaluated using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Pearson's correlation analysis. Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the internal consistency. RESULTS: A three-factor model eventually showed acceptable fit indices in the CFA. Moreover, the correlation results among the three factors indicated discriminant validity comparable to the original NPI. The correlation results with acute fatigue, chronic fatigue, and burnout verified convergent validity. Internal consistency was insufficient. CONCLUSION: The NPI-J demonstrated acceptable construct validity. This instrument can assess nurses' perceptions of their performance by measuring each item. Future work on the reliability of the sub-concepts will require additional items or reliability testing based on generalizability theory and item response theory.",

        "abstract": "We previously hypothesized that functional cognitive disorder is characterized by heightened subjective mental effort, exhausted attentional reserve and metacognitive failure. To test this hypothesis, we administered a Stroop colour-word task in which attentional demand was varied by task difficulty (congruent versus incongruent cues) and the presence of a secondary auditory stimulus (passive or active listening to an oddball-type paradigm). We measured subjective mental effort, objective performance (reaction times and accuracy), metacognition and EEG-based biomarkers of mental workload. We tested 19 functional cognitive disorder patients and 23 healthy controls. Patients reported higher levels of depression, anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep disruption, dissociation and obsessiveness. They rated their memory as significantly poorer than healthy controls; however, accuracy did not differ between groups in any condition. In contrast to healthy controls, patients rated their performance as poorer on the congruent Stroop task with background noise compared to silent conditions. Functional cognitive disorder was consistently associated with slower reaction times but this was not exacerbated by increased attentional demand. Patients but not healthy controls reported greater mental workload in noisy conditions but EEG biomarkers were similar between groups, regardless of task difficulty. Functional cognitive disorder has significant syndromic overlap with mood disorders and chronic fatigue and pain. It is associated with global metacognitive failure whereas local (task-specific) metacognition is only selectively impaired. Patients were slower than healthy controls, which might contribute to the 'brain fog' reported in this condition. Although subjective mental effort was increased in noisy conditions, we found no evidence of attentional exhaustion in functional cognitive disorder. Our results indicate that functional cognitive disorder is a multisystem condition affecting reaction time, subjective mental effort and global metacognition.",

The number of the cases has been increasing during the era of COVID-19 pandemic. Acupuncture may have some effect on chronic fatigue syndrome, but its mechanism remains unclear. This article was to summarize the specific manifestations of abnormal central mechanism in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome through laboratory tests and neuroimaging. It was found from the laboratory evaluation that there were changes in the structure of the frontal cortex, thalamus and other brain tissues; factors, including IFN-\u03b1 and IL-10 in cerebrospinal fluid were found abnormal; results of oxidative and nitrosative stress and changes in neurobiochemical substances, e.g. hypothalamus hormone levels and neurotransmitter concentrations, were observed. With magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography, it was shown that the partial brain of persons with chronic fatigue syndrome had morphological changes with diminished grey matter and white; changes in cerebral blood flow velocity caused by decreased perfusion and functional activity with abnormal connectivity in brain were detected. In addition, there was significant decrease in glucose metabolism accompanied with neuroinflammatory response; metabolic disorders of serotonergic, cholinergic, glutamatergic and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid energy neurotransmitters were also discovered.

Methodology We distributed a web-based survey among patients diagnosed with COVID-19\u00a0across the world and collected 190 responses regarding their demographics, histories, COVID-19 infection courses, and common symptoms. Results We found that about 85.3% of the patients experienced some form of symptom following recovery from the infection. Among the reported symptoms, 59% of patients experienced fatigue or lethargy, 48.9% reported decreased stamina, 32.6% reported\u00a0shortness of breath, 16.8% had a persistent cough, and 23.7% experienced anxiety following recovery from COVID-19.

The main aim of this research was to analyse the possible effects of a synbiotic (Synbiotic, Gasteel Plus\u00ae (Heel Espa\u00f1a S.A.U.), through the study of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8/IL-10) and neuroendocrine biomarkers (cortisol and DHEA), in order to evaluate the interaction between inflammatory and stress responses mediated by the cytokine-HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis, as well as mental and physical health using body composition analysis, accelerometry and previously validated questionnaires. The participants were women diagnosed with FM with or without a diagnostic of CFS. Each participant was evaluated at baseline and after the intervention, which lasted one month. Synbiotic intervention decreased levels of perceived stress, anxiety and depression, as well as improved quality of life during daily activities. In addition, the synbiotic generated an activation of HPA axis (physiological cortisol release) that can compensate the increased inflammatory status (elevated IL-8) observed at baseline in FM patients. There were no detrimental changes in body composition or sleep parameters, as well as in the most of the activity/sedentarism-related parameters studied by accelerometry. It is concluded that synbiotic nutritional supplements can improve the dysregulated immunoneuroendocrine interaction involving inflammatory and stress responses in women diagnosed with FM, particularly in those without a previous CFS diagnostic; as well as their perceived of levels stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) is considered to be a multidimensional illness whose etiology is unknown. However, reports from Chernobyl, as well as those from the United States, have revealed an association between radiation exposure and the development of CFIDS. As such, we present an expanded model using a systems biology approach to explain the etiology of CFIDS as it relates to this cohort of patients. This paper proposes an integrated model with ionizing radiation as a suggested trigger for CFIDS mediated through UVA induction and biophoton generation inside the body resulting from radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE). Evidence in support of this approach has been organized into a systems view linking CFIDS illness markers with the initiating events, in this case, low-dose radiation exposure. This results in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as important immunologic and other downstream effects. Furthermore, the model implicates melanoma and subsequent hematopoietic dysregulation in this underlying process. Through the identification of this association with melanoma, clinical medicine, including dermatology, hematology, and oncology, can now begin to apply its expansive knowledge base to provide new treatment options for an illness that has had few effective treatments.",

Using a Symptom Severity Scale (SSS) that includes nine common symptoms of ME/CFS, we sought to characterize the duration and severity of PEM symptoms following two cardiopulmonary exercise tests separated by 24 h (2-day CPET). Materials and Methods: Eighty persons with ME/CFS and 64 controls (CTL) underwent a 2-day CPET. ME/CFS subjects met the Canadian Clinical Criteria for diagnosis of ME/CFS; controls were healthy but not participating in regular physical activity. All subjects who met maximal effort criteria on both CPETs were included. SSS scores were obtained at baseline, immediately prior to both CPETs, the day after the second CPET, and every two days after the CPET-1 for 10 days. Results: There was a highly significant difference in judged recovery time (ME/CFS = 12.7 \u00b1 1.2 d; CTL = 2.1 \u00b1 0.2 d, mean \u00b1 s.e.m., Chi2 = 90.1, p < 0.0001). The range of ME/CFS patient recovery was 1-64 days, while the range in CTL was 1-10 days; one subject with ME/CFS had not recovered after one year and was not included in the analysis. Less than 10% of subjects with ME/CFS took more than three weeks to recover. There was no difference in recovery time based on the level of pre-test symptoms prior to CPET-1 (F = 1.12, p = 0.33). Mean SSS scores at baseline were significantly higher than at pre-CPET-1 (5.70 \u00b1 0.16 vs. 4.02 \u00b1 0.18, p < 0.0001). Pharmacokinetic models showed an extremely prolonged decay of the PEM response (Chi2 > 22, p < 0.0001) to the 2-day CPET. Conclusions: ME/CFS subjects took an average of about two weeks to recover from a 2-day CPET, whereas sedentary controls needed only two days. These data quantitate the prolonged recovery time in ME/CFS and improve the ability to obtain well-informed consent prior to doing exercise testing in persons with ME/CFS. Quantitative monitoring of PEM symptoms may provide a method to help manage PEM.",

        "abstract": "Primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMM) are a clinically and genetically highly heterogeneous group that, in some cases, may manifest exclusively as fatigue and exercise intolerance, with minimal or no signs on examination. On these occasions, the symptoms can be confused with the much more common chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Nonetheless, other possibilities must be excluded for the final diagnosis of CFS, with PMM being one of the primary differential diagnoses. For this reason, many patients with CFS undergo extensive studies, including extensive genetic testing and muscle biopsies, to rule out this possibility. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) as a potential biomarker to distinguish which patient with chronic fatigue has a mitochondrial disorder. We studied 34 adult patients with symptoms of fatigue and exercise intolerance with a definitive diagnosis of PMM (7), CFS (22), or other non-mitochondrial disorders (5). The results indicate that GDF-15 can accurately discriminate between patients with PMM and CFS (AUC = 0.95) and between PMM and patients with fatigue due to other non-mitochondrial disorders (AUC = 0.94). Therefore, GDF-15 emerges as a promising biomarker to select which patients with fatigue should undergo further studies to exclude mitochondrial disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may persist for weeks or years. However, nonpharmacological management strategies for fatigue alleviations are almost nonexistent; thus, effective fatigue management programs are needed urgently. PURPOSES: We aimed to evaluate the effects of self-administered acupressure programs on post-TBI fatigue and heart rate variability and identify the possible correlation between the improvements in fatigue symptoms and the changes in heart rate variability. DESIGN: This randomized controlled trial included 2-point acupressure (TPA; n = 27), 5-point acupressure (FPA; n = 27), and usual care (UC, control; n = 27) groups who underwent several assessments before and after the study intervention. Heart rate variability was evaluated at baseline, weeks 2 and 3, and treatment completion. METHODS: The TPA and FPA groups self-administered acupressure (3 minutes per acupoint; bilateral), thrice daily for 4 weeks, whereas the UC group received routine treatment without acupressure. RESULTS: Both the TPA and FPA groups exhibited substantial improvements in fatigue symptoms compared with the baseline findings in the UC group. In addition, the TPA and FPA groups exhibited increased high-frequency power and mean number of times per hour in which the changes in successive normal sinus intervals (RR) gradually exceeded 50 ms (pNN50). Changes in high-frequency power and pNN50 were correlated with improvements in post-TBI fatigue symptoms. CONCLUSION: Acupressure may alleviate chronic fatigue and enhance parasympathetic activity in TBI survivors. The enhancement of parasympathetic activity may be correlated with improvements in post-TBI fatigue symptoms. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Healthcare providers should incorporate self-administered acupressure into the care plans for TBI survivors to improve their fatigue symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly used as adjunctive treatment modalities for a variety of conditions refractory to medical management. Right or left stellate ganglion blocks (SGB) are a specific type of peripheral nerve block that target the sympathetic blockade of neuronal impulses using the injection of local anesthetic and steroids into nerve bundles in the cervical area. This review article is intended to summarize the common uses of stellate ganglion blocks and explain the procedural technique, which has evolved with technological advances in ultrasonography. The similarities between these disease processes are centered around sympathetic hyperactivity. This sympathetic overdrive state is created by increased levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), which causes a cascade of sympathetic sprouting resulting in increased norepinephrine (NE) systemically. Reversal of this cascade by local anesthetic injection into the stellate ganglion thereby reduces NGF and sympathetic sprouting subsequently lowering overall norepinephrine levels. This is the unifying theory by which SGB is able to provide resolution for the varied clinical conditions described in this article.\u00a0 This review article discusses the physiology of several conditions where stellate ganglion blocks are being investigated as an adjunct treatment modality, including anosmia, PTSD, long-COVID, chronic fatigue syndrome, menopausal hot flashes, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Overall, the current literature supporting the use of stellate ganglion blocks for several esoteric conditions is limited; however, case reports to date have shown promising evidence-based results supporting their use as an adjunctive treatment among patients with refractory symptoms to existing treatment algorithms. In conclusion, SGB should be considered among patients with refractory symptoms for medical management in the conditions discussed in this article. Further research is needed to delineate which patients will benefit from the use of SGB, the use of subsequent blocks and timelines in between injections, and unilateral versus bilateral blockade.",

PASC is highly heterogenous and may be associated with multisystem tissue damage/dysfunction including acute encephalitis, cardiopulmonary syndromes, fibrosis, hepatobiliary damages, gastrointestinal dysregulation, myocardial infarction, neuromuscular syndromes, neuropsychiatric disorders, pulmonary damage, renal failure, stroke, and vascular endothelial dysregulation. A better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying PASC is essential to guide prevention and treatment. This review addresses potential mechanisms and hypotheses that connect SARS-CoV-2 infection to long-term health consequences. Comparisons between PASC and other virus-initiated chronic syndromes such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome will be addressed. Aligning symptoms with other chronic syndromes and identifying potentially regulated common underlining pathways may be necessary for understanding the true nature of PASC. The discussed contributors to PASC symptoms include sequelae from acute SARS-CoV-2 injury to one or more organs, persistent reservoirs of the replicating virus or its remnants in several tissues, re-activation of latent pathogens such as Epstein-Barr and herpes viruses in COVID-19 immune-dysregulated tissue environment, SARS-CoV-2 interactions with host microbiome/virome communities, clotting/coagulation dysregulation, dysfunctional brainstem/vagus nerve signaling, dysautonomia or autonomic dysfunction, ongoing activity of primed immune cells, and autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry between pathogen and host proteins.

        "abstract": "Insomnia is associated with fatigue, but it is unclear whether response to cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia is altered in individuals with co-occurring symptoms of insomnia and chronic fatigue. This is a secondary analysis using data from 1717 participants with self-reported insomnia in a community-based randomized controlled trial of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia compared with patient education. We employed baseline ratings of the Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire to identify participants with more or fewer symptoms of self-reported chronic fatigue (chronic fatigue, n\u00a0=\u00a0592; no chronic fatigue, n\u00a0=\u00a01125). We used linear mixed models with Insomnia Severity Index, Short Form-12 mental health, Short Form-12 physical health, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale separately as outcome variables. The main covariates were main effects and interactions for time (baseline versus 9-week follow-up), intervention, and chronic fatigue. Participants with chronic fatigue reported significantly greater improvements following digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia compared with patient education on the Insomnia Severity Index (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a01.36, p\u2009<\u20090.001), Short Form-12 mental health (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.19, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). There were no significant differences in the effectiveness of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia between chronic fatigue and no chronic fatigue participants on any outcome. We conclude that in a large community-based sample of adults with insomnia, co-occurring chronic fatigue did not moderate the effectiveness of digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia on any of the tested outcomes. This may further establish digital cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia as an adjunctive intervention in individuals with physical and mental disorders.",

This study aimed to explore the autonomic responses through an orthostatic test and analysis of the peripheral skin temperature variations and vascular endothelium state in ME/CFS patients. Sixty-seven adult female ME/CFS patients and 48 healthy controls were enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed using validated self-reported outcome measures. Postural changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and wrist temperature were recorded during the orthostatic test. Actigraphy during one week was used to determine the 24-h profile of peripheral temperature and activity. Circulating endothelial biomarkers were measured as indicators of endothelial functioning. Results showed that ME/CFS patients presented higher blood pressure and heart rate values than healthy controls in the supine and standing position (p < 0.05 for both), and also a higher amplitude of the activity rhythm (p < 0.01). Circulating levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were significantly higher in ME/CFS (p < 0.05). In ME/CFS, ET-1 levels were associated with the stability of the temperature rhythm (p < 0.01), and also with the self-reported questionnaires (p < 0.001).

Whether a patient with long COVID might develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is of interest, as is the treatment and management of ME/CFS in a post-COVID patient. Here I report a patient, who, after an infection with SARS-CoV-2, developed ME/CFS and recovered after treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a previously healthy 55-year-old woman who worked as a nurse and became ill with COVID-19 pneumonia. She then presented with severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise, dyspnea, pain, cognitive dysfunction, tachycardia, and exacerbation of fatigue on physical exertion, which persisted for more than 6\u00a0months after her recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. She was bedridden for more than half of each day. The patient was treated from multiple perspectives, which included (1) instructions on eating habits and supplements; (2) cognitive and behavioral modifications for coping with physical, emotional, and cognitive fatigue; (3) instructions on conditioning exercises to improve deconditioning due to fatigue and dyspnea; and (4) pharmacotherapy with amitriptyline and hochuekkito, a Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine.

Burnout rate was significantly increased in the group with chronic fatigue symptoms (Fatigue Severity Scale\u2009\u2265\u20093.22) after the outbreak of COVID-19 (OR, 3.94; 95% CI 2.80-5.56), in the female group (OR, 2.05; 95% CI 1.46-2.86), in the group with physical symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-15\u2009\u2265\u200910) after the outbreak of COVID-19 (OR, 2.03; 95% CI 1.14-3.60), in the group with a higher Global Assessment of Recent Stress scale (OR, 1.71; 95% CI 1.46-2.01), in the group with post-traumatic stress symptoms (Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder-5\u2009\u2265\u20092) (OR, 1.47; 95% CI 1.08-2.01), and in the younger age group(OR, 1.45; 95% CI 1.22-1.72). The chronic fatigue symptoms were correlated with cumulative days of care (OR, 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.37). The physical symptoms were correlated with average contact hours with COVID-19 patients per day (OR, 1.34; 95% CI 1.17-1.54), and cumulative days of care (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.06-1.38). Most Korean healthcare workers suffered from burnout related to excessive workload during the COVID-19 pandemic. During a widespread health crisis like COVID-19, it is necessary to regularly check the burnout status in healthcare workers and reduce their excessive workload by supplementing the workforce and providing appropriate working hours sufficient rest hours.",

Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a key symptom that distinguishes ME/CFS patients. Investigating changes in the urine metabolome between ME/CFS patients and healthy subjects following exertion may help us understand PEM. The aim of this pilot study was to comprehensively characterize the urine metabolomes of eight female healthy sedentary control subjects and ten female ME/CFS patients in response to a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Each subject provided urine samples at baseline and 24 h post-exercise. A total of 1403 metabolites were detected via LC-MS/MS by Metabolon\u00ae including amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides, cofactors and vitamins, xenobiotics, and unknown compounds. Using a linear mixed effects model, pathway enrichment analysis, topology analysis, and correlations between urine and plasma metabolite levels, significant differences were discovered between controls and ME/CFS patients in many lipid (steroids, acyl carnitines and acyl glycines) and amino acid subpathways (cysteine, methionine, SAM, and taurine; leucine, isoleucine, and valine; polyamine; tryptophan; and urea cycle, arginine and proline).

In addition to pain, the disorder presents with a broad range of symptoms, such as sleep disruption, chronic fatigue, brain fog, depression, muscle stiffness, and migraine. FM has a considerable female prevalence, and it has been shown that symptoms are influenced by the menstrual cycle and periods of significant hormonal and immunological changes. There is increasing evidence that females with FM experience an aggravation of symptoms in pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester and after childbirth. In this perspective paper, we focus on the neuro-endocrine interactions that occur between progesterone, allopregnanolone, and cortisol during pregnancy, and propose that they align with our previously proposed model of FM pathogenesis based on GABAergic \"weakening\" in a thalamocortical neural loop system.

        "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Prior studies report that the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can adversely affect gut microbiota and gastrointestinal uptake of micronutrients, in particular iron and magnesium, and are used frequently by kidney transplant recipients. Altered gut microbiota, iron deficiency, and magnesium deficiency have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic fatigue. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI use may be an important and underappreciated cause of fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Kidney transplant recipients (\u22651 year after transplantation) enrolled in the TransplantLines Biobank and Cohort Study. EXPOSURE: PPI use, PPI type, PPI dosage, and duration of PPI use. OUTCOME: Fatigue and HRQoL, assessed using the validated Checklist Individual Strength 20 Revised questionnaire and Short Form-36 questionnaire. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Logistic and linear regression. RESULTS: We included 937 kidney transplant recipients (mean age 56\u00b113 years, 39% female) at a median of 3 (1-10) years after transplantation. PPI use was associated with fatigue severity (regression coefficient 4.02, 95% CI, 2.18 to 5.85, P<0.001), a higher risk of severe fatigue (OR 2.05, 95% CI, 1.48 to 2.84, P<0.001), lower physical HRQoL (regression coefficient-8.54, 95% CI,\u00a0-11.54 to-5.54, P<0.001), and lower mental HRQoL (regression coefficient-4.66, 95% CI,\u00a0-7.15 to-2.17, P<0.001). These associations were independent of potential confounders including age, time since transplantation, history of upper gastrointestinal disease, antiplatelet therapy, and the total number of medications. They were present among all individually assessed PPI types and were dose dependent. Duration of PPI exposure was only associated with fatigue severity. LIMITATIONS: Residual confounding and inability to assess causal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: PPI use is independently associated with fatigue and lower HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. PPI use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving HRQoL among kidney transplant recipients. Further studies examining the effect of PPI exposure in this population are warranted. PLAIN-LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In this observational study, we investigated the association of proton pump inhibitors with fatigue and health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients. Our data showed that proton pump inhibitors were independently associated with fatigue severity, severe fatigue, and lower physical and mental health-related quality of life. These associations were present among all individually assessed proton pump inhibitor types and were dose dependent. While we await future studies on this topic, proton pump inhibitor use might be an easily accessible target for alleviating fatigue and improving health-related quality of life among kidney transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "Chronic fatigue symptoms of jobs are risk factors that may cause errors and lead to occupational accidents. For instance, occupational injuries and traffic accidents stem from overlooking long-term fatigue. According to statistics for fatigue driving, it was found that fatigue driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents. The resulting decrease in the quality of traffic, as well as impaired traffic flow efficiency and functioning, contributes markedly to the societal costs of fatigue. This article proposes a noninvasive physical method for fatigue detection using a machine vision image algorithm. The main technology was implemented using a software framework based on optimized skin color segmentation and edge detection, as well as eye contour extraction. By integrating machine vision and an optimized Hove transform algorithm, our method mainly identifies fatigue based on the detected target's face, head gestures, mouth aspect ratio (MAR), and eye condition, and then triggers an alarm through an intelligent auxiliary device. Our evaluation results of facial image data analysis showed that with an ideal eye threshold of 0.3, PERCLOS-80 standard, MAR, and head gesture-nod frequency, the method can be used to detect fatigue data accurately and systematically, thereby fulfilling the purpose of alerting a group of high-risk drivers and preventing them from engaging in high-risk activities in an involuntary state.",

To determine if ME/CFS is just a more extreme form of fatigue, or a qualitatively different condition, we assessed whether risk factors for ME/CFS and for Severe Fatigue were similar. An email questionnaire that inquired about symptoms of Severe Fatigue and ME/CFS was completed by 41,802 US female nurses from whom detailed medical and lifestyle information had been collected since 1989: 102 met criteria for ME/CFS, 522 had Severe Fatigue, and 41,178 individuals were without significant chronic fatigue. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the Hazard Ratio (HR) of Severe Fatigue and of ME/CFS with each of several potential risk factors, according to the level of exposure to each risk factor. The risk of Severe Fatigue was significantly increased among participants who were older, had a higher BMI in adulthood, used hormone therapy, had increased alcohol intake and decreased caffeine intake. In contrast, these risk factor associations were not seen in people with ME/CFS. A self-reported past history of acute infectious mononucleosis was associated with a non-significantly increased Hazard Ratio of later ME/CFS (HR 1.77, 0.87-3.61) and, to a lesser extent, of Severe Fatigue (HR 1.28, 0.98-1.66).

        "abstract": "Misdiagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) can occur when different case definitions are used by clinicians (relative misdiagnosis) or when failing the genuine diagnosis of another disease (misdiagnosis in a strict sense). This problem translates to a recurrent difficulty in reproducing research findings. To tackle this problem, we simulated data from case-control studies under misdiagnosis in a strict sense. We then estimated the power to detect a genuine association between a potential causal factor and ME/CFS. A minimum power of 80% was obtained for studies with more than 500 individuals per study group. When the simulation study was extended to the situation where the potential causal factor could not be determined perfectly (e.g., seropositive/seronegative in serological association studies), the minimum power of 80% could only be achieved in studies with more than 1000 individuals per group. In conclusion, current ME/CFS studies have suboptimal power under the assumption of misdiagnosis. This power can be improved by increasing the overall sample size using multi-centric studies, reporting the excluded illnesses and their exclusion criteria, or focusing on a homogeneous cohort of ME/CFS patients with a specific pathological mechanism where the chance of misdiagnosis is reduced.",

It has been suggested that subgroups of people with ME/CFS exist, displaying a specific cluster of symptoms. Investigating symptom-based clusters may provide a better understanding of ME/CFS. Therefore, this study aimed to identify clusters in people with ME/CFS based on the frequency and severity of symptoms. METHODS: Members of the Dutch ME/CFS Foundation completed an online version of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire version 2. Self-organizing maps (SOM) were used to generate symptom-based clusters using severity and frequency scores of the 79 measured symptoms. An extra dataset (n\u2009=\u2009252) was used to assess the reproducibility of the symptom-based clusters. RESULTS: Data of 337 participants were analyzed (82% female; median (IQR) age: 55 (44-63) years). 45 clusters were identified, of which 13 clusters included \u2265\u200910 patients. Fatigue and PEM were reported across all of the symptom-based clusters, but the clusters were defined by a distinct pattern of symptom severity and frequency, as well as differences in clinical characteristics. 11% of the patients could not be classified into one of the 13 largest clusters. Applying the trained SOM to validation sample, resulted in a similar symptom pattern compared the Dutch dataset. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that in ME/CFS there are subgroups of patients displaying a similar pattern of symptoms. These symptom-based clusters were confirmed in an independent ME/CFS sample. Classification of ME/CFS patients according to severity and symptom patterns might be useful to develop tailored treatment options.",

METHODS: An analysis utilizing the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was conducted. Participants included were 6303 patients with CFS newly diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 and 6303 age-/sex-matched controls. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the CFS group had a higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder before the diagnosis of CFS.

This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of ginseng and ginseng herbal formulas for fatigue in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Methods: The authors searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) databases from inception to July 6, 2022. Outcomes included fatigue severity, quality of life (QoL), and adverse events (AEs). Quality of evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. They pooled all included data and performed subgroup analysis by fatigue type, assessment instrument, and ginseng type. Results: The authors included 19 RCTs. Pooled analyses found no significant reduction in fatigue severity with ginseng versus controls (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.82 to 0.11, p\u2009=\u20090.13).

Ginseng was associated with a trend toward QoL improvement (p\u2009=\u20090.05) and did not increase AEs compared with controls. Effect sizes were small. Conclusion: Ginseng herbal formulas improved fatigue severity compared to controls, especially among patients with CF, but with a small effect size.

Many patients reported ongoing [neuromuscular (50%) respiratory (39%), chronic fatigue (35%), cardiovascular (30%), gastrointestinal (28%), neurocognitive (22%), genitourinary (22%), and mood-related (13%)] symptoms at least once 1-24\u00a0months after discharge. Common specialty follow-ups included cardiology (25%), vascular medicine (17%), urology (17%), neurology (16%), and pulmonology (14%), with some associated with pre-existing comorbidities and with COVID-19. Common new specialty visits were vascular medicine (11%), pulmonology (11%), and neurology (9%). ICU patients had more symptoms and follow-ups compared to the non-ICU patients. This study reported high incidence of persistent symptoms and medical specialty care needs in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors 1-24\u00a0months post-discharge. Some specialty care needs were COVID-19 related or exacerbated by COVID-19 disease while others were associated with pre-existing medical conditions. Longer follow-up studies of COVID-19 survivor medical care needs are necessary.",

        "title": "[The influence of sleep deprivation on the cognitive processes in medical students during exam session].",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Along with socio-economic pression increase in developed countries, the progressive shortening of night sleep has been observed. Sleep plays a vital role in human organism regeneration, and its deprivation leads to a series of adverse psychosomatic effects, including intellectual performance limitation or reducing body immunity, which increases susceptibility to diseases. Chronic sleep deprivation, quite often affecting medical students, significantly contributes to hypersomnia and leads to chronic fatigue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The results of 60 students were analysed; students were divided into 2 subgroups, depending on the average sleep duration during previous 2-3 nights: IA (2.3\u00b10.8 h on average) and IB (4.9\u00b10.5 h on average). The control group consisted of 50 students, whose night sleep duration in that period was 7.5\u00b10.62 h. In all subjects under analysis visual and auditory evoked potentials were registered, which is a non-invasive method of cognitive performance tests. RESULTS: The obtained results showed that people with average night sleep duration 2.3\u00b10.8 h (subgroup IA) had worse rate and precision of stimulus response, and thereby significantly worse (p < 0.001) sensorimotor performance, then those from subgroup IB. The study of evoked potentials showed significant (from p < 0.04 to p < 0.001) elongation of all latency p-waves connected with the stimulus perception (N75) and attention span (P100, N135). Moreover, significant elongation of visual latency wave P100 and auditory wave V was related to psychophysical fatigue occurring in sleep deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of this study results, obtained in medical students showed that sleep deprivation occurring during exam session is closely related to cognitive abilities, which in turn adversely affects the academic achievement. These results indicate that night sleep duration is a differentiating factor for cognitive abilities quality. Also, psychosomatic fatigue adversely affects cognitive processes.

Separately, both chronic pain and chronic fatigue contribute to physical and cognitive decline in older adults. Concurrent pain and fatigue symptoms may increase disability and diminish quality of life, though little data exist to show this. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between self-reported pain and fatigue, both independently and combined, with cognitive and physical function in middle-older-aged adults with chronic knee pain. Using a cross-sectional study design participants (n\u00a0=\u00a0206, age 58.0 \u00b1 8.3) completed questionnaires on pain and fatigue, a physical performance battery to assess physical function, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Hierarchical regressions and moderation analyses were used to assess the relationship between the variables of interest. Pain and fatigue both predicted physical function (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.305, p < 0.001; \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.219, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, respectively), however only pain significantly predicted cognitive function (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.295, p <0.001). A centered pain*fatigue interaction was a significant predictor of both cognitive function (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.137, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and physical function (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.146, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048). These findings indicate that self-reported fatigue may contribute primarily to decline in physical function among individuals with chronic pain, and less so to decline in cognitive function. Future studies should examine the impact of both cognitive and physical function decline together on overall disability and health.",

Therefore, aim of the study was to evaluate the course of chronic fatigue symptoms in non-hospitalized subjects with the SARS-CoV-2 infection, according to sex. METHODS: Patients and staff from the University Hospital in Krakow anonymously and retrospectively completed neuropsychological questionnaire that included eight symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. The presence of these symptoms was assessed before COVID-19 and 0-4, 4-12, and >12\u00a0weeks postinfection. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 or more years, >12\u00a0weeks since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and diagnosis confirmed by the RT-PCR from anasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: We included 303 patients (79.53% women, 47.52% medical personnel) assessed retrospectively after a median of 30 (interquartile range: 23-35) weeks since the onset of symptoms. A higher prevalence of at least one chronic fatigue symptom was found in females in all time intervals after the onset of COVID-19 compared to males (p\u00a0<\u00a0.036).

        "abstract": "The number of patients suffering from long-COVID is currently increasing rapidly, even after the acute symptoms of COVID-19 have improved. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a pilot transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment on neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID. In this study, we examined the efficacy of the TMS treatment protocol, which has been established to be effective in refractory depression, by applying it to patients who sought TMS treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID at TMS clinics in Tokyo, Japan in the context of the real world TMS registry study in Japan. Of the 23 patients (13 females) with long-COVID included in this case series, the main neuropsychiatric symptoms were chronic fatigue (n\u00a0=\u00a012) and cognitive dysfunction (n\u00a0=\u00a011), but most patients also showed mild depressive symptoms. The mean score on the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale before TMS treatment was 21.2, which improved to 9.8 after treatment. Similarly, the score on the Performance Status, which assesses the degree of fatigue, improved from 5.4 to 4.2, and the score on the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression 5-item, which reflects cognitive function, improved from 10.0 to 6.3. Although a few patients complained of pain at the stimulation site during the TMS as a side effect, there were no serious adverse events. Despite the limitations of this open-label pilot study, the TMS protocol implemented in this study may have beneficial effects on neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by long-COVID, including depressive symptoms, chronic fatigue, and cognitive impairment. These preliminary findings warrant further validation in randomized controlled trials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a paediatric Short Fatigue Questionnaire (pSFQ) assesses a valid construct for subjective fatigue, to assess its psychometric properties and provide a cut-off score for severe fatigue in children. METHODS: The pSFQ consists of 4 items from the Checklist Individual Strength-8 (CIS-8). Data of previous studies using the CIS-8 were used to assess the pSFQ in healthy children (n\u00a0=\u00a0316), children with chronic fatigue syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a0173), and children with a chronic disease (n\u00a0=\u00a0442). All children were 12-18\u00a0years old. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed, followed by Cronbach alpha's to investigate internal consistency, and Spearman's correlations to assess construct validity. With ROC analysis, we determined a cut-off score for severe fatigue and provide normative data on the pSFQ for children with and without a chronic disease. RESULTS: CFA confirmed a one-factor model in the pSFQ representing subjective fatigue. Cronbach's alpha ranged from good to excellent (0.84-0.94), as did construct validity (-0.76 and\u00a0-\u00a00.87 for correlation with two other fatigue measurements). ROC analysis delivered a cut-off score of \u226521, with a sensitivity of 93.9% and specificity of 96.2% for severe fatigue. Normative data for children with and without a chronic disease showed similar patterns compared to other fatigue questionnaires. CONCLUSION: The pSFQ is a practical and reliable screening instrument for severe fatigue in children with and without a chronic disease, and effectively reduces the questionnaire length with 50% compared to the conventional CIS-8.",

The most common clinical manifestations of MS are spasticity, pain, vesico-urethral disorders, cognitive impairments, chronic fatigue and sexual dysfunction. This review aims to explore the possible therapeutic options for managing sexual dysfunction in people with MS (PwMS). METHOD: A thorough search of the PubMed Medline database was performed. Records were limited to clinical studies published between 01/01/2010 up to 01/01/2022. The results were screened by the authors in pairs. RESULTS: The search identified 36 records. After screening, 9 records met the inclusion-exclusion criteria and were assessed. The pharmacological approaches investigated the effectiveness of sildenafil, tadalafil and onabotulinumtoxinA. Of the interventional studies the non-pharmacological investigated, the effectiveness of aquatic exercises, the application of pelvic floor exercises,the combination of pelvic floor exercises and mindfulness technique, the combination of pelvic floor exercises and electro muscular stimulation with electromyograph biofeedback, the application of yoga techniques and the efficacy of assistive devices like the clitoral vacuum suction device and the vibration device. CONCLUSION: The management of sexual dysfunction in PwMS needs to be further investigated.

Differences in fatigue perpetuating factors, assessed with the Cognitive Behavioural Responses to Symptoms Questionnaire (CBRQ), between diagnostic groups were tested using ANCOVAs. Linear regression and mediation analyses were used to investigate moderation and mediation by CBRQ scores of the treatment effect. RESULTS: There were small to moderate differences in CBRQ scores between LTCs. Patients with higher scores on the subscales damage beliefs and avoidance/resting behaviour at baseline showed less improvement following CBT, irrespective of diagnosis. Reduction in fear avoidance, catastrophising and avoidance/resting behaviour mediated the positive effect of CBT on fatigue across diagnostic groups.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: to describe the demographic features, symptoms, impact on activities of daily living, school attendance and time to diagnosis. DESIGN: Prospective surveillance study conducted by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Paediatricians was asked if they had assessed a child with severe ME/CFS (screening definition for prevalence and incidence: children (5-16 years) diagnosed with ME/CFS so severe that they are unable to attend school for more than 1\u2009hour a week during the last 6 weeks of the school term). PARTICIPANTS: Patients 5-16\u2009years of age, seen by paediatricians and two large ME/CFS specialist services across the UK and Ireland. OUTCOME MEASURES: Paediatrician-completed questionnaires describing demographics, symptoms, function and treatment, (applying National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-recommended criteria to assess severity of ME/CFS). Diagnosis of severe, probable severe or possible severe ME/CFS was made only with evidence of NICE-recommended screening blood tests.

The present study was performed to examine the effects of SpO2 and PBT during acute infection on immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Lowered SpO2 strongly predicts OSTOX/ANTIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation. The results suggest that post-viral somatic and mental symptoms have a neuroimmune and neuro-oxidative origin.",

METHODS: The goal of present study is to prove whether EA could relieve fatigue through enhancing anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in in\u00a0vitro/in\u00a0vivo models. RESULTS: EA notably improved activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), while EA reduced levels of malondiadehyde (MDA) and inflammatory cytokines without cytotoxicity in H2O2-stimulated in myoblast cell line, C2C12 cells. EA significantly reduced levels of fatigue-causing factors such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatin kinase (CK), while EA significantly incresed levels of anti-fatigue-related factor, glycogen compared to the H2O2-stimulated C2C12 cells. In treadmill stress test (TST), EA significantly enhanced activities of SOD and CAT as well as exhaustive time and decreased levels of MDA and inflammatory cytokines. After TST, levels of free fatty acid, citrate synthase, and muscle glycogen were notably enhanced by oral administration of EA, but EA decreased levels of lactate, LDH, cortisol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, CK, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen compared to the control group. Furthermore, in forced swimming test, EA significantly increased levels of anti-fatigue-related factors and decreased excessive accumulations of fatigue-causing factors.

However, these case definitions are consensus-based rather than empirical. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the validity of the aforementioned case definitions by factor analyzing a large, international sample (N\u2009=\u20092308) of ME/CFS symptom data. We performed primary and secondary exploratory factor analyses on the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire's 54-item symptom inventory. These results were compared to the CCC, the ME-ICC, and the IOM criteria. RESULTS: We identified seven symptom domains, including post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction. Contrary to many existing case criteria, our analyses did not identify pain as an independent factor. CONCLUSIONS: Although our results implicate a factor solution that best supports the CCC, revisions to the criteria are recommended.Implications for rehabilitationME/CFS is a chronic illness with no consensus regarding case diagnostic criteria, which creates difficulty for patients seeking assistance and disability benefits.The current study compared three commonly used case definitions for ME/CFS by factor analyzing symptomological data from an international sample of patients.Our results suggest three primary and four secondary symptom domains which differed from all three case definitions.These findings could help reduce barriers to care for those disabled with ME/CFS by guiding the development of an empirically-based case definition.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: It is generally accepted that functional somatic disorders (FSDs) are a product of biological, psychological, and social factors. Social position might be part of this complex, but the literature on this issue is currently heterogeneous and inconsistent. The aim of the present study was - in a population-based cohort - to test the hypothesis that lower social position would be associated with higher a risk of FSD. METHOD: The association between social position and FSD was examined in a cross-sectional study with various measures of social position (education as measured by vocational training; employment; cohabitation; subjective social status) and delimitations of FSD (irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, bodily distress syndrome, and symptom profiles). The associations were analyzed using logistic regressions to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Each social measure was analyzed independently and was adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Lower levels of vocational training, being unemployed, and living alone were associated with higher risk of FSD, regardless of the FSD delimitation. There was also a significant negative association between subjective evaluated social status and FSD. The associations remained after multiple adjustments, and seemed to be strongest for the more severe FSD-types. CONCLUSIONS: Lower social position is associated with higher risk of FSD, especially the more severe FSD delimitations, which might constitute an especially vulnerable group. However, the mechanisms behind the relations remain unknown.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: It is not clear why psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in the functional somatic syndromes than other general medical illnesses. This study assessed the correlates of psychiatric disorders in 3 functional syndromes and 3 general medical illnesses in a population-based sample. METHODS: The Lifelines cohort study included 122,366 adults with relevant data for 6 self-reported conditions: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and diabetes. For each condition the proportion with a DSM-IV psychiatric disorder was assessed. In a cross-sectional design, logistic regression identified at baseline the variables most closely associated with current psychiatric disorder in participants with a pre-existing medical or functional condition. In a separate analysis the prevalence of psychiatric disorder prior to onset of these conditions was assessed. This was a longitudinal study with psychiatric disorder assessed at baseline in participants who subsequently developed a general medical or functional condition between baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of psychiatric disorder was higher (17-27%) in the functional somatic syndromes than the general medical illnesses (10.4-11.7%). The variables closely associated with psychiatric disorder were similar in the functional syndromes and general medical illnesses: stressful life events, chronic personal health difficulties, neuroticism, poor perception of general health, impairment of function due to physical illness and reported previous (lifetime) psychiatric disorder. The prevalence of psychiatric disorder prior to development of these disorder was similar to that of established disorders. CONCLUSION: Despite the difference in prevalence, the correlates of psychiatric disorders were similar in functional and general medical disorders and included predisposing and environmental factors. The increased rate of psychiatric disorder in functional somatic syndromes appears to be evident before onset of the syndrome.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During a standard 70-degree head-up tilt test, 90% of adults with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) develop an abnormal reduction in cerebral blood flow (CBF). A 70-degree test might not be tolerated by young ME/CFS patients because of the high incidence of syncopal spells. This study examined whether a test at 20 degrees would be sufficient to provoke important reductions in CBF in young ME/CFS patients. METHODS: We analyzed 83 studies of adolescent ME/CFS patients. We assessed CBF using extracranial Doppler measurements of the internal carotid and vertebral arteries supine and during the tilt. We studied 42 adolescents during a 20 degree and 41 during a 70 degree test. RESULTS: At 20 degrees, no patients developed postural orthostatic tachycardia (POTS), compared to 32% at 70 degrees (p\u2009=\u20090.0002). The CBF reduction during the 20 degree tilt of -27(6)% was slightly less than during the reduction during a 70 degree test [-31(7)%; p\u2009=\u20090.003]. Seventeen adolescents had CBF measurements at both 20 and 70 degrees. The CBF reduction in these patients with both a 20 and 70 degrees test was significantly larger at 70 degrees than at 20 degrees (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A 20 degree tilt in young ME/CFS patients resulted in a CBF reduction comparable to that in adult patients during a 70 degree test. The lower tilt angle provoked less POTS, emphasizing the importance of using the 70 degree angle for that diagnosis. Further study is needed to explore whether CBF measurements during tilt provide an improved standard for classifying orthostatic intolerance.",

        "abstract": "Mitochondria play a key role in both health and disease. Their function is not limited to energy production but serves multiple mechanisms varying from iron and calcium homeostasis to the production of hormones and neurotransmitters, such as melatonin. They enable and influence communication at all physical levels through interaction with other organelles, the nucleus, and the outside environment. The literature suggests crosstalk mechanisms between mitochondria and circadian clocks, the gut microbiota, and the immune system. They might even be the hub supporting and integrating activity across all these domains. Hence, they might be the (missing) link in both health and disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to metabolic syndrome, neuronal diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases, and inflammatory disorders. In this regard, diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and chronic pain are discussed. This review focuses on understanding the mitochondrial mechanisms of action that allow for the maintenance of mitochondrial health and the pathways toward dysregulated mechanisms. Although mitochondria have allowed us to adapt to changes over the course of evolution, in turn, evolution has shaped mitochondria. Each evolution-based intervention influences mitochondria in its own way. The use of physiological stress triggers tolerance to the stressor, achieving adaptability and resistance. This review describes strategies that could recover mitochondrial functioning in multiple diseases, providing a comprehensive, root-cause-focused, integrative approach to recovering health and treating people suffering from chronic diseases.",

It has been proposed that \"third wave\" therapies may be beneficial variants of cognitive behavioral treatments. However, evidence on their efficacy is scarce. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy of \"third wave\" psychotherapies (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy [MBCT], mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], and acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]) in adults with bodily distress. METHOD: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) treating adults with bodily distress using MBCT, MBSR, and ACT compared to inactive and non-specific control groups. A random effects model was used. The primary outcome was somatic symptom severity. Secondary outcomes were degrees of depression and of anxiety, health anxiety, perceived health status, mindfulness, psychological inflexibility, and pain acceptance. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs with 1,288 participants were included in the analysis (k = 4 MBCT, k = 7 MBSR, k = 5 ACT; k = 7 fibromyalgia, k = 5 irritable bowel syndrome, k = 1 chronic fatigue syndrome, k = 2 bodily distress, k = 1 medically unexplained symptoms). However, not all studies provided data for each of the relevant outcomes. The analyses revealed that \"third wave\" therapies were more effective than control conditions in reducing somatic symptom severity (k = 15, n = 1,100, g = -0.51, 95%CI -0.69; -0.32). Heterogeneity was moderate (I 2 = 52.8%, 95%CI 15.1 to 73.8). Effects for secondary outcomes were small to moderate with varying degrees of heterogeneity. We did not find differences between the different therapy approaches (mindfulness- vs. acceptance-based therapies); neither therapy dosis (i.e., total duration of therapy sessions) nor number of sessions were significant moderators of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The therapies addressing mindfulness and acceptance proved to be more effective than control conditions. Hence, they are promising treatment approaches for bodily distress.

In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on fatigue severity in a group of patients with post-COVID syndrome and chronic fatigue. We conducted a double-blind, parallel-group, sham-controlled study to evaluate the short-term effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (2\u2005mA, 20\u2005min/day) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The modified fatigue impact scale score was used as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included cognition (Stroop test), depressive symptoms (Beck depression inventory) and quality of life (EuroQol-5D). Patients received eight sessions of transcranial direct current stimulation and were evaluated at baseline, immediately after the last session, and one month later. Forty-seven patients were enrolled (23 in the active treatment group and 24 in the sham treatment group); the mean age was 45.66 \u00b1 9.49 years, and 37 (78.72%) were women. The mean progression time since the acute infection was 20.68 \u00b1 6.34 months. Active transcranial direct current stimulation was associated with a statistically significant improvement in physical fatigue at the end of treatment and 1 month as compared with sham stimulation. No significant effect was detected for cognitive fatigue. In terms of secondary outcomes, active transcranial direct current stimulation was associated with an improvement in depressive symptoms at the end of treatment. The treatment had no effects on the quality of life. All the adverse events reported were mild and transient, with no differences between the active stimulation and sham stimulation groups. In conclusion, our results suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may improve physical fatigue. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and optimize stimulation protocols.",

The etiology of self-reported BII is unknown. Some patients have limited resolution of symptoms despite implant removal, and the mechanism of persistent symptoms is unclear. Notably, there are a number of prevalent, chronic systemic illnesses and other factors which present with the most common physical symptoms of self-reported BII. Fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, autoimmune disorders, and hypothyroidism often produce fatigue, joint and muscle pain, \"brain fog,\" anxiety or depression, and hair loss in affected patients who may or may not have breast implants. Other factors such as anxiety with or without depression, perimenopause, aging, cigarette smoking/marijuana use, and prominent side effects from common medications are known to produce similar symptoms as those reported by patients concerned with BII. The possibility that patients with breast implants have an undiagnosed, chronic illness unrelated to breast implants should be considered as well as other factors which may produce similar symptoms. Plastic surgeons should be aware of the range of illnesses and factors which can produce physical symptoms similar to those of patients with self-reported BII. For patients in which a systemic illness or other factor is felt to play a contributory role to self-reported BII symptoms, referral to an internist or rheumatologist for a thorough history and physical examination to rule out conditions may be prudent before explantation. This may reduce the need for explantation if the etiology of systemic symptoms is found to be unrelated to breast implants.",

        "abstract": "Fatigue is a major symptom in many diseases, often among the most common and severe ones and may last for an extremely long period. Chronic fatigue impacts quality of life, reduces the capacity to perform activities of daily living, and has socioeconomical consequences such as impairing return to work. Despite the high prevalence and deleterious consequences of fatigue, little is known about its etiology. Numerous causes have been proposed to explain chronic fatigue. They encompass psychosocial and behavioral aspects (e.g., sleep disorders) and biological (e.g., inflammation), hematological (e.g., anemia) as well as physiological origins. Among the potential causes of chronic fatigue is the role of altered acute fatigue resistance, i.e. an increased fatigability for a given exercise, that is related to physical deconditioning. For instance, we and others have recently evidenced that relationships between chronic fatigue and increased objective fatigability, defined as an abnormal deterioration of functional capacity (maximal force or power), provided objective fatigability is appropriately measured. Indeed, in most studies in the field of chronic diseases, objective fatigability is measured during single-joint, isometric exercises. While those studies are valuable from a fundamental science point of view, they do not allow to test the patients in ecological situations when the purpose is to search for a link with chronic fatigue. As a complementary measure to the evaluation of neuromuscular function (i.e., fatigability), studying the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is also of great interest in the context of fatigue. The challenge of evaluating objective fatigability and ANS dysfunction appropriately (i.e.,. how?) will be discussed in the first part of the present article. New tools recently developed to measure objective fatigability and muscle function will be presented. In the second part of the paper, we will discuss the interest of measuring objective fatigability and ANS (i.e. why?). Despite the beneficial effects of physical activity in attenuating chronic fatigue have been demonstrated, a better evaluation of fatigue etiology will allow to personalize the training intervention. We believe this is key in order to account for the complex, multifactorial nature of chronic fatigue.",

METHODS: The population-based Lifelines cohort study included 148,614 adults with relevant data for the fibromyalgia study and 136,423 for the CFS study. Participants with prior self-reported fibromyalgia (or CFS) at baseline were excluded from the relevant analysis. At follow-up (mean 2.4\u2009years), new onsets of each syndrome were identified by self-report. Logistic regression was used to identify which of the baseline variables predicted new onsets of each syndrome. The total number of psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, burnout, panic disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive, and eating disorders) was used as a predictor. Prior to the analyses the samples were divided into those with and without marked muscle pain (for fibromyalgia analysis) or persistent fatigue (for CFS). RESULTS: During follow-up, there were 685/136,423 (0.5%) new onsets of self-reported FM in participants without marked muscle pain and 281/7481 (3.75%) in those with such pain; for CFS it was 292/124,223 (0.2%) for those without and 192/10,025 (1.9%) for those with baseline fatigue. In both univariate and logistic regression analyses of participants with prior persistent fatigue psychiatric disorder was clearly associated with onset of CFS. This was not so for onset of fibromyalgia in participants with prior muscle pain. DISCUSSION: Although psychiatric disorders did not predict self-reported fibromyalgia or CFS in participants free of pain or fatigue at baseline, in this study psychiatric disorder did predict self-reported CFS in the presence of pre-existing fatigue. Progress in understanding the etiology of these disorders may require studying separately onsets with and without pre-existing key symptoms.",

However, large randomly selected population-based studies of this association are sparse. This study aimed to investigate the association between FSD and perceived stress and self-efficacy, respectively, and to investigate if FSD differed from severe physical diseases on these aspects. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a random sample of the adult Danish population (n = 9656). FSD were established using self-reported questionnaires and diagnostic interviews. Perceived stress was measured with Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale and self-efficacy with the General Self-Efficacy Scale. Data were analysed with generalized linear models and linear regression models. RESULTS: FSD were associated with higher perceived stress and lower self-efficacy, especially for the multi-organ and the general symptoms/fatigue FSD types and for chronic fatigue. However, controlling for the personality trait neuroticism altered the associations with self-efficacy so it became insignificant. The analysis did not support an important interaction between perceived stress and self-efficacy on the likelihood of having FSD. Individuals with FSD presented levels of perceived stress that were not equal, ie higher, to those in individuals with severe physical diseases. CONCLUSION: FSD were positively associated with perceived stress and negatively associated with self-efficacy. Our study may point to stress being part of the symptomatology of FSD. This underlines the severity of having FSD and stresses the relevance of the resilience theory in the understanding of the condition.",

We analyzed demographic characteristics according to sex, age group, clinical findings, behavior after diagnosis, family and social behavior, sequelae, clinical evolution, type of exposure, and personal history. RESULTS: The sample analyzed had a mean age of 37 years (95% CI 18-66), women 713 individuals (49.27%), men 733 individuals (50.66%). Age group distribution was 18-30 years, 524 individuals (36.29%), 31-45, 538 individuals (37.26), and more of 45 years, 382 individuals (26.46%). 1416 individuals were mestizos (97.99%).

Brief instruments for detecting PEM are critical for clinical and scientific progress. OBJECTIVE: To develop a clinical prediction rule for PEM. METHOD: 49 ME/CFS and 10 healthy, sedentary subjects recruited from the community completed two maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) separated by 24 hours. At five different times, subjects reported symptoms which were then classified into 19 categories. The frequency of symptom reports between groups at each time point was compared using Fisher's exact test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis with area under the curve calculation was used to determine the number of different types of symptom reports that were sufficient to differentiate between ME/CFS and sedentary groups. The optimal number of symptoms was determined where sensitivity and specificity of the types of symptom reports were balanced. RESULTS: At all timepoints, a maximum of two symptoms was optimal to determine differences between groups. Only one symptom was necessary to optimally differentiate between groups at one week following the second CPET. Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, lack of positive feelings/mood and decrease in function were consistent predictors of ME/CFS group membership across timepoints. CONCLUSION: Inquiring about post-exertional cognitive dysfunction, decline in function, and lack of positive feelings/mood may help identify PEM quickly and accurately.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the measurement properties of the PEM/PESE Activity Questionnaire (PAQ). METHODS: The PAQ is adapted from the Patient Specific Functional Scale. Respondents rated three self-selected ADLs on two 0-100 scales, including current performance compared to (1) a 'good day' and (2) before illness. Respondents provided a Burden of Functioning rating on a 0-100 scale, anchored at 0 being the activity took \"No time, effort, and resources at all\" and 10 being \"All of my time, effort, and resources.\" Respondents took the PAQ twice, completing a demographic questionnaire after the first PAQ and before the second PAQ. Descriptive statistics and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated for each scale to assess test-retest reliability. Minimum detectable change outside the 95% confidence interval (MDC95) was calculated.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a complex, multi-system neurological condition. The defining feature of ME is post-exertional malaise (PEM) with over 30 symptoms triggered by physical, cognitive, emotional and social activity. The cause of PEM is unclear but one area of research using cardio-pulmonary exercise tests show a reduced ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) with repeated tests leading to PEM. Pacing with heart rate monitoring (HRM) provides feedback to maintain activity intensity below the VAT. There is only one piece of research investigating the use of HRM although a number of guidelines recommend it. OBJECTIVE: To identify the experiences and attitudes of people with ME towards HRM. METHODS: A 40 question online survey was devised and released on ME websites, Twitter and Facebook pages. People with ME read the information sheet and followed an online link to the survey. The survey was open for three weeks and all answers were anonymous. RESULTS: 488 people with ME completed the survey. Most participants were female, 35-50 years and with a reported illness of greater than 5 years. Over 100 types of HR monitor used. Over 30 benefits and over 30 negatives identified. HRM reduced severity of ME and severity and duration of PEM. CONCLUSION: Although there are limitations, HRM has many benefits including helping PwME to understand and manage their PEM and support them to increase their activities, including work. There is a need for more research and education of healthcare professionals in the safe use of HRM.",

Additionally, provide empirical evidence on the usefulness of this computerized neuropsychological test to assess ME/CFS. METHOD: The final sample (n =\u2009225; 158 Patients/67 Healthy controls) were recruited in a Central Sensitization Syndromes (CSS) specialized unit in a tertiary hospital. All participants were administered this neuropsychological test. RESULTS: There were significant differences between ME/CFS and healthy controls in all the main measures of CPT3\u2122. Mainly, patients had a worse indicator of inattentiveness, sustained attention, vigilance, impulsivity, slow reaction time, and more atypical T-scores, which is associated with a likelihood of having a disorder characterized by attention deficits, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In addition, relevant correlations were obtained between the CPT3\u2122 variables in the patient's group. The most discriminative indicators of ME/CFS patients were Variability and Hit Reaction Time, both measures of response speed. CONCLUSION: The CPT3\u2122 is a helpful tool to discriminate neurocognitive impairments from attention and response speed in ME/CFS patients, and it could be used as a marker of ME/CFS severity for diagnosing or monitoring this disease.",

We aimed to clarify the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for treating these symptoms. METHODS: High-frequency rTMS was applied to occipital and frontal lobes in 12 patients with chronic fatigue and cognitive dysfunction 3 months after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Before and after ten sessions of rTMS, Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Apathy Scale (AS), and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition (WAIS4) were determined and N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed.

        "abstract": "Recent studies provide some evidence for the contribution of antibody-mediated autoimmune mechanisms to the nature of fibromyalgia (FM) and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Much attention was paid to the autoantibodies (AAb) targeting G protein-coupled receptors as natural components of the immune system. However, the natural AAb network is much more extensive, and has not been previously investigated in these disorders. The enzyme immunoassays ELI-Viscero-Test and ELI-Neuro-Test were used to determine changes in serum content of 33 natural AAb to neural, organ-specific and non-tissue-specific autoantigens (a) in 11 ME/CFS patients with comorbid FM; (b) in 11 ME/CFS patients without FM; (c) in 11 healthy controls. Individual AAb profiles and their correlation with some clinical symptoms were analyzed. Both patients with ME/CFS(-)FM and ME/CFS(+)FM were characterized by more frequent and pronounced deviations in the immunoreactivity to GABA-receptors than healthy controls. Although the level of other natural AAb did not differ between study groups, AAb correlation signatures were altered in patients compared to healthy controls. Both in patients and healthy controls the level of natural AAb to various neural and tissue-specific antigens correlated with the severity of fatigue, bodily pain, depression, anxiety, physical and mental health-related quality of life. Notably, widely different correlation patterns were observed between study groups. Findings from this pilot study provide some evidence that the homeostasis of autoimmune relationships, which are possibly a physiological part of our immune system, may be altered in FM and ME/CFS. The correlation of disease-induced perturbations in individual AAb profiles with some clinical symptoms may arise from the immune system's ability to reflect qualitative and quantitative changes in antigenic composition of the body.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Long-term fatigue is a common condition that involves both physical and psychiatric symptoms, and it affects multiple age groups and causes morbidity and disabling symptoms that range from mild to severe symptoms. Many patients are discharged following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection without proper follow-up and evaluation of long-term effects, resulting in the improper treatment of the long-term symptoms, which increases the burden on the patients and healthcare systems. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2. It results in a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, respiratory distress, the loss of the sense of smell and taste, and long-term effects such as post-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is characterized by chronic fatigue, sleep disturbances, myalgia, weakness, and depression. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of long-term fatigue in patients who achieved remission from COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), National Guards Health Affairs, Riyadh. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, non-probability convenience sampling study. All participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and achieved remission were approached in an outpatient department (OPD)\u00a0setting and signed an informed consent form and were evaluated by standard questionnaires at clinics after remission from COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 343 subjects who fit the inclusion criteria of any patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and achieved remission were included in the study. This study included patients from the National Guard Hospital, students, and staff members. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of long-term fatigue in patients who achieved remission from COVID-19 as measured by the Chalder fatigue scale (CFQ). The participants were approached in clinics and general\u202fOPD\u00a0by one of the research teams. Results Based on the study design, 343 patients were selected from King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, the incidence of long-term fatigue in patients who achieved remission from COVID-19 was 55.7%, and the rest were normal (44.3%). The incidence of long-term fatigue was statistically significantly higher in females\u00a0and those who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and achieved remission for more than two months. The\u00a0age of the participants ranged from 18 to more than 45, with a predominance of females (60.6%). Regarding body mass index (BMI), 39.9% were overweight, and 29.2% were obese. Additionally, the incidence of patients with associated chronic disease was 27.4%; among these chronic diseases, hypertension was the most common one (18.1%), followed by diabetes (17%) and thyroid diseases (14.9%). Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that were carried out in Saudi Arabia that assess long-term fatigue post COVID-19 infection. In our study, we discovered that long-term fatigue was highly prevalent (55.7%). We found that among those participants, more than half of those who reported chronic fatigue had a COVID-19 diagnosis for longer than two months. Furthermore, females made up the majority of those who had long-term fatigue. We urge that additional longitudinal and standardized studies be carried out in order to thoroughly determine the severity of long-term fatigue in patients who obtained remission from COVID-19.",

Chronotropic incompetence (CI), defined as an impaired chronotropic response or reduced increases in heart rate during exercise and resulting in lower exercise capacity, may also be observed during orthostasis in patients with ME. Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: In this study, the recordings of 101 adult patients with ME (36 men, 65 women; mean [\u00b1SD] age 37\u00b112 years) who underwent conventional active 10-min standing tests at least 3 times to determine the presence of CI were analyzed. Recordings were selected for 13 patients who experienced tests both with and without exhibiting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS; an increase in heart rate of \u226530 beats/min or an actual heart rate of \u2265120 beats/min) while also both successfully completing and failing to complete 10-min standing on different occasions. Subjects in whom failure without POTS was observed in any test(s) while success was associated with POTS on other occasions were considered positive for CI during orthostasis. Of the 13 patients, 12 (92%) were CI positive, 5 (38%) of whom exclusively failed the tests without experiencing POTS. Conclusions: Some patients with ME were CI positive during standing tests, suggesting impaired sympathetic activation.

Our study aimed to evaluate transcriptomic changes in ME/CFS female patients undergoing an exercise challenge intended to precipitate PEM. Our time points (baseline before exercise challenge, the point of maximal exertion, and after an exercise challenge) allowed for the exploration of the transcriptomic response to exercise and recovery in female patients with ME/CFS, as compared to healthy controls (HCs). Under maximal exertion, ME/CFS patients did not show significant changes in gene expression, while HCs demonstrated altered functional gene networks related to signaling and integral functions of their immune cells. During the recovery period (commonly during onset of PEM), female ME/CFS patients showed dysregulated immune signaling pathways and dysfunctional cellular responses to stress.

To investigate whether infection with COVID-19 actually causes ME/CFS, this paper obtained pooled data from the Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) and analyzed the relationship between COVID susceptibility, hospitalization and severity of COVID and ME/CFS, respectively, using two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR). TSMR analysis was performed by inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median method, MR-Egger regression and weighted mode and simple mode methods, respectively, and then the causal relationship between COVID-19 and ME/CFS was further evaluated by odds ratio (OR). Eventually, we found that COVID-19 severity, hospitalization and susceptibility were all not significantly correlated with ME/CFS (OR:1.000,1.000,1.000; 95% CI:0.999-1.000, 0.999-1.001, 0.998-1.002; p = 0.333, 0.862, 0.998, respectively). We found the results to be reliable after sensitivity analysis. These results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection may not significantly contribute to the elevated risk of developing CFS, and therefore ME/CFS may not be a sequela of COVID-19, but may simply present with symptoms similar to those of CFS after COVID-19 infection, and thus should be judged and differentiated by physicians when diagnosing and treating the disease in clinical practice.",

Currently, there are 14 proposed subtypes of EDS, with all except one subtype (hypermobile EDS) having an identified genetic etiology. An understanding of the extracutaneous features and complications within each subtype is key to maximizing clinical care and reducing the risk of further complications. METHODS: A systematic review of EDS-related extracutaneous features and complications was undertaken. RESULTS: We identified 839 EDS cases that met the inclusion criteria. We noted a high prevalence of joint hypermobility amongst kyphoscoliotic (39/39, 100%), spondylodysplastic (24/25, 96.0%), and hypermobile (153/160, 95.6%) EDS subtypes. The most common musculoskeletal complications were decreased bone density (39/43, 90.7%), joint pain (217/270, 80.4%), and hypotonia/weakness (79/140, 56.4%). Vascular EDS presented with cerebrovascular events (25/153, 16.3%), aneurysm (77/245, 31.4%), arterial dissection/rupture (89/250, 35.5%), and pneumothorax/hemothorax. Chronic pain was the most common miscellaneous complication, disproportionately affecting hypermobile EDS patients (139/157, 88.5%). Hypermobile EDS cases also presented with chronic fatigue (61/63, 96.8%) and gastrointestinal complications (57/63, 90.5%). Neuropsychiatric complications were noted in almost all subtypes.

        "abstract": "The etiopathogenesis of fibromyalgia (FM) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not yet elucidated. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction is reflected in the hormonal disturbances found in FM and CFS. Some study groups have introduced a novel hypothesis that moderate or intermittent intracranial hypertension may be involved in the etiopathogenesis of FM and CFS. In these conditions, hormonal disturbances may be caused by the mechanical effect of increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which hampers blood flow in the pituitary gland. Severe intracranial pressure may compress the pituitary gland, resulting in primary empty sella (ES), potentially leading to pituitary hormone deficiencies. The aim of this narrative review was to explore whether similar hormonal changes and symptoms exist between primary ES and FM or CFS and to link them to cerebrospinal fluid pressure dysregulation. A thorough search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases and the reference lists of the included studies revealed that several clinical characteristics were more prevalent in primary ES, FM or CFS patients than in controls, including increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure, obesity, female sex, headaches and migraine, fatigue, visual disturbances (visual acuity and eye motility abnormalities), vestibulocochlear disturbances (vertigo and neurosensorial hearing loss), and bodily pain (radicular pain and small-fiber neuropathy). Furthermore, challenge tests of the pituitary gland showed similar abnormalities in all three conditions: blunted adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone responses and an increased prolactin response. The findings of this narrative review provide further support for the hypothesis that moderately or intermittently increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure is involved in the pathogenesis of FM and CFS and should stimulate further research into the etiopathogenesis of these conditions.",

In a Norwegian cohort of Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors (HLS), more than a decade after contemporary risk-adapted treatment regimens with limited use of radiotherapy (RT), we assessed: (1) Prevalence of, (2) factors associated with (3) and implications of CF on socioeconomic status (SES) and work ability (WA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: HLS treated between 1997-2006, aged 8-49 years at diagnosis, were invited to participate in a population-based cross-sectional study on late effects in 2018-2019. In a mailed questionnaire, HLS responded to a fatigue questionnaire (FQ), work ability score (WAS) and short-form health survey (SF-36). Disease- and treatment data were extracted from hospital records. Factors associated with CF were identified by uni- and multivariate analysis. To study the implications of CF on SES and WA, a multinomial regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Invitations were extended to 518 HLS and 298 (58%) responded to FQ, of whom 42% had CF with mean (standard deviation [SD]) physical- and mental fatigue scores of 10.2 (4.3) and 5.5 (2.1) respectively. Median age at survey was 45\u2009years, 47% were females. In multivariate analysis female sex (p\u2009=\u20090.03), lower education (p\u2009=\u20090.03), body mass index \u226530\u2009kg/m2 (p\u2009=\u20090.04), and an increasing number of comorbidities (p\u2009=\u20090.01) were associated with CF. No association with disease stage, chemotherapy or RT was found. CF was associated with poorer WAS scores at survey (p\u2009<\u20090.001), unemployment (p\u2009=\u20090.03), and receiving disability pension (p\u2009=\u20090.003). CONCLUSION: After risk-adapted treatment, CF is still a frequent LE among long-term HLS, without apparent association with disease or treatment-related parameters. CF is associated with reduced WA and SES. As no apparent risk reduction is seen with contemporary treatment, further studies should emphasize etiological factors of CF and treatment to alleviate this common LE.",

The sample (N = 340) was comprised of academic teachers employed at Polish higher education institutions who have experienced changes in the work environment in recent years. We conducted a multiple regression analysis to determine the relationships among stress, burnout, and chronic fatigue, looking at coping strategies and rest as a moderator. The results indicate that there is a strong relationship between stress resulting from an excessively demanding work environment on the one hand and occupational burnout and chronic fatigue on the other. At the same time, selected health behaviours of academic teachers only slightly moderate the analyzed relationship. Avoidance strategies strengthen the relationship between stress and its negative consequences, while rest and-to a limited extent-the amount of sleep only slightly contribute to weakening the analyzed relationship.",

The aim of this study was to follow the development of fatigue among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients prospectively and longitudinally and to analyze predictors for acute and chronic fatigue. METHODS: HNC patients treated with curative intent were included at diagnosis and completed the following questionnaires multiple times, up to 5\u2009years after treatment: the EORTC QLQ-FA12 for fatigue, EORTC QLQ-C30, and HNC-specific EORTC QLQ-H&N35 together with an anxiety and depression questionnaire. Predictors of fatigue were evaluated at 3\u2009months and 5\u2009years after treatment. RESULTS: Of the 311 study participants, 74% responded at the 5-year follow-up. Physical fatigue was significantly worse 3\u2009months after treatment, while emotional and cognitive fatigue were the worst at diagnosis and at 3\u2009months. All fatigue domains were significantly better after 1\u2009year, and the fatigue scores remained stable from 1 until 5\u2009years after treatment. Three months after chemoradiotherapy, physical fatigue was more significant, but no long-term differences due to treatment modalities were found. Depression and anxiety were predictors for chronic emotional fatigue, and local HN pain and swallowing problems were predictors for chronic physical fatigue. Better global quality of life at diagnosis was associated with less physical and emotional fatigue. CONCLUSION: Fatigue was worst in the short term for HNC patients and improved after 1\u2009year, and long-term fatigue remained stable up to 5\u2009years after treatment. A few predictors for chronic fatigue were found. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 133:2211-2221, 2023.",

        "abstract": "Healthy lifestyle is one of the most important factors in the prevention of premature deaths, chronic diseases, productivity loss, obesity, and other economic and social aspects. The workplace plays an important role in promoting the physical activity and wellbeing of employees. Previous studies are mostly focused on individual interviews, various questionnaires that are a conceptual information about individual health state and might change according to question formulation, specialist competence, and other aspects. In this paper the work ability was mostly related to the employee's physiological state, which consists of three separate systems: cardiovascular, muscular, and neural. Each state consists of several exercises or tests that need to be performed one after another. The proposed data transformation uses fuzzy logic and different membership functions with three or five thresholds, according to the analyzed physiological feature. The transformed datasets are then classified into three stages that correspond to good, moderate, and poor health condition using machine learning techniques. A three-part Random Forest method was applied, where each part corresponds to a separate system. The obtained testing accuracies were 93%, 87%, and 73% for cardiovascular, muscular, and neural human body systems, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed work ability evaluation process may become a good tool for the prevention of possible accidents at work, chronic fatigue, or other health problems.",

Reanalysis of data from a study by Jason comparing symptom reports from two groups of ME/CFS and PASC patients shows a notably similar symptomatology. Symptom scores of the PASC group and the ME/CFS group correlated 0.902 (p < 0.0001) across items. The hypothesis is presented that ME/CFS and PASC are caused by a chronic state of multisystemic disequilibrium including endocrinological, immunological, and/or metabolic changes. The hypothesis holds that a changed set point persistently pushes the organism towards a pathological dysfunctional state which fails to reset. To use an analogy of a thermostat, if the \u2018off switch\u2019 of a thermostat intermittently stops working, for periods the house would become warmer and warmer without limit. The hypothesis draws on recent investigations of the Central Homeostasis Network showing multiple interconnections between the autonomic system, central nervous system, and brain stem. The hypothesis helps to explain the shared symptomatology of ME/CFS and PASC and the unpredictable, intermittent, and fluctuating pattern of symptoms of ME/CFS and PASC.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disease characterized by various symptoms such as pathological fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and inability to recover energy after waking up. The Yijinjing, a kind of health care practice from ancient China, consists of 12 movements, and it is considered as one of the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for health maintenance, health care, and disease healing. In this study, multiple scales were used to evaluate the effects of Yijinjing intervention on the clinical symptoms of CFS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with CFS were randomly assigned to Yijinjing group and the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) group separately. The Yijinjing intervention was practiced 6 times per week, among which one exercise should be guided by the teacher of the faculty in the university, and another 5 times should be finished at home over 12 consecutive weeks. Similarly, the control group received cognitive education, including popular science lectures and psychological counseling related to CFS prevention and treatment for 12 weeks. Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory-20 (MFI-20), Short Form 36-item Health Survey (SF-36), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: Intra-group analysis showed that the differences in MFI-20, SF-36, and PSQI were statistically significant (p < 0.05) after the intervention of 12 weeks Yijinjing intervention. Compared with the CBT group, the differences in MFI-20 and PSQI of the Yijinjing group were statistically significant (p < 0.05), but SF-36 was superior to the CBT group in terms of physical function, bodily pain, general health, and vitality (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Yijinjing can significantly improve sleep disorders, fatigue, and quality of life in patients with CFS and is superior to behavioral cognitive education in pain and vitality.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the autonomic nerve stimulation effect of epipharyngeal abrasive therapy (EAT) on myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) associated with chronic epipharyngitis. Heart rate variability analysis was performed. The study was conducted by analyzing heart rate variability. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 29 patients with chronic epipharyngitis who underwent EAT from July 2017 to April 2018 were classified into two groups: 11 patients in the CFS group\u00a0and 18 patients in the control group without CFS. The patients were classified as phase 1 during bed rest, phase 2 during nasal endoscopy, phase 3 during nasal abrasion, and phase 4 during oral abrasion. Electrocardiographic recordings were made, and autonomic function was compared and evaluated by measuring heart rate, coefficient of variation on R-R interval (CVRR), coefficient of component variance high frequency (ccvHF), and low frequency/ccvHF ratio (L/H) for each of the four phases.\u00a0The Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to confirm the normality of the two groups, and the parametric test was selected. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to assess changes over time between the four events in the two groups. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the Bonferroni method. Comparisons between resting data and three events within each group were performed by paired t-test. RESULTS: The CFS group had an increased baseline heart rate compared to the control group, and the CFS group had a greater increase in parasympathetic activity and a decrease in heart rate with nasal abrasion. Oral abrasion elicited a pharyngeal reflex and increased heart rate and both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. CONCLUSION: The CFS group was in a state of dysautonomia due to autonomic overstimulation, with an elevated baseline heart rate. The CFS group was considered to be in a state of impaired autonomic homeostasis, with an increased likelihood that overstimulation would induce a pathological vagal reflex and the Reilly phenomenon would develop. The direct effects of EAT on the autonomic nervous system were considered to be vagus nerve stimulation and the regulation of autonomic function by opposing stimulation input to sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. As an indirect effect, bleeding from the epipharyngeal mucosa due to abrasion was thought to restore the function of the cerebral venous and lymphatic excretory systems and the autonomic nerve center.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Topical use of corticosteroids causes systemic effects, but systemic toxicity by ingesting topical corticosteroid cream has not been reported. We describe a patient admitted with ingestion of over-the-counter (OTC) hydrocortisone cream. CASE REPORT: A 64-year-old woman presented with 2-weeks of generalized weakness. She had a history of hypertension, anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome, but medical records were unavailable and she was not on any medications. She reported taking prednisone 7.5\u00a0mg daily for several years, which was discontinued 5 months ago. Due to worsening symptoms, she started ingesting OTC topical hydrocortisone as replacement and admitted to consuming 2 squirts of 1% hydrocortisone cream twice daily over the previous month leading up to hospitalization. Her pulse rate was 77/min, blood pressure was 232/110\u00a0mmHg. There was no pedal edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, hirsutism, muscle wasting, or purplish skin striae. Labs revealed potassium 1.5\u00a0mg/dL (3.6-5.4), serum cortisol 61.5\u00a0\u03bcg/dL (2.3-19.4), Creatine Kinase 1864 IU/L (24-173), undetectable adrenocorticotropic hormone. She received potassium, labetalol, and intravenous fluids. Her serum cortisol level decreased to 11\u00a0\u03bcg/dL and potassium to 4.1\u00a0mg/dL within 24\u00a0hours. She left the hospital against medical advice on Day 2. DISCUSSION: Although both prednisone and hydrocortisone have glucocorticoid properties, only hydrocortisone has mineralocorticoid properties. Hydrocortisone 20\u00a0mg provides a mineralocorticoid effect equivalent to 0.1\u00a0mg fludrocortisone. CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone cream was confirmed as the source of exogenous corticosteroid by an undetectable adrenocorticotropic hormone and rapid decrease in cortisol following discontinuation. Incorrect use of OTC medications can lead to life-threatening side effects.",

The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A/B, HHV-7, and parvovirus B19 (B19V) in the etiopathogenesis of ME/CFS. METHODS: 200 patients with clinically diagnosed ME/CFS and 150 apparently healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. Single-round, nested, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were used to detect the presence and load of HHV-6A/B, HHV-7, and B19V. HHV-6A and HHV-6B were distinguished by PCR and restriction analysis. Immunoenzymatic assays were applied to estimate the presence of virus-specific antibodies and the level of cytokines. RESULTS: HHV-6A/B, HHV-7, and B19V specific antibodies were detected among patients and healthy individuals in 92.1% and 76.7%, 84.6% and 93.8%, and 78% and 67.4% of cases. HHV-6B had 99% of HHV-6 positive patients. Latent HHV-6A/B, HHV-7, and B19V infection/co-infection was observed in 51.5% of the patients and 76.7% of the healthy individuals, whereas active-45% of the ME/CFS patients and 8.7% of healthy individuals. HHV-6A/B load in patients with a persistent infection/co-infection in a latent and active phase was 262 and 653.2 copies/106 cells, whereas HHV-7 load was 166.5 and 248.5 copies/106 cells, and B19V-96.8 and 250.8 copies/106 cells, respectively. ME/CFS patients with persistent infection in an active phase had a higher level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-\u03b1) and IL-12) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) than with a persistent infection in a latent phase. A significant difference was revealed in the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-10 among the patient groups without infection, with latent infection/co-infection, active single, double and triple co-infection. The levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-10 are significantly higher in patients with severe compared with a moderate course of ME/CFS. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more persistent HHV-6A/B, HHV-7, and B19V infection/co-infection in an active phase with a higher viral load and elevated levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines among patients with ME/CFS than healthy individuals indicate the importance of these infections/co-infections in ME/CFS development.

        "abstract": "The German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) recently published its draft report to the government about myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The IQWiG concluded that graded exercise therapy (GET) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) should be recommended in the treatment for mild and moderate ME/CFS based on two CBT and two GET studies. In this article, we reviewed the evidence used by IQWiG to support their claims, because their conclusion is diametrically opposed to the conclusion by the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in its recently updated ME/CFS guidelines. Our analysis shows that the trials IQWiG used in support suffered from serious flaws, which included badly designed control groups; relying on subjective primary outcomes in non-blinded studies; alliance and response shift bias, including patients in their trials who did not have the disease under investigation, selective reporting, making extensive endpoint changes and low to very low adherence of treatments. Our analysis also shows that the report itself used one CBT and one GET study that both examined a different treatment. The report also used a definition of CBT that does not reflect the way it is being used in ME/CFS or was tested in the studies. The report noted that one study used a wrong definition of post-exertional malaise (PEM), the main characteristic of the disease, according to the report. Yet, it ignored the consequence of this, that less than the required minimum percentage of patients had the disease under investigation in that study. It also ignored the absence of improvement on most of the subjective outcomes, as well as the fact that the IQWiG methods handbook states that one should use objective outcomes and not rely on subjective outcomes in non-blinded studies. The report concluded that both treatments did not lead to objective improvement in the six-minute walk test but then ignored that. The report did not analyze the other objective outcomes of the studies (step test and occupational and benefits status), which showed a null effect. Finally, the report states that the studies do not report on safety yet assumes that the treatments are safe based on a tendency towards small subjective improvements in fatigue and physical functioning, even though the adherence to the treatments was (very) low and the studies included many patients who did not have the disease under investigation and, consequently, did not suffer from exertion intolerance contrary to ME/CFS patients. At the same time, it ignored and downplayed all the evidence that both treatments are not safe, even when the evidence was produced by a British university. In conclusion, the studies used by the report do not provide any evidence that CBT and GET are safe and effective. Consequently, the report and the studies do not provide any support for the recommendation to use CBT and GET for ME/CFS or long COVID, which, in many cases, is the same or resembles ME/CFS, after an infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

        "abstract": "This paper reviews the current understanding of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and whether any treatment strategies have been effective. ME/CFS is a condition of as yet unknown etiology that commonly follows an infective process. It includes a new onset of fatigue (of more than 3-6 month duration and not relieved by rest), post-exertional malaise, cognitive difficulties and unrefreshing sleep, and frequently orthostatic intolerance, somatic symptoms and pain. Long COVID has renewed interest in the condition and stimulated research with findings suggestive of a multisystem neuroimmune disease. There are no definitively effective treatments. Despite earlier recommendations regarding graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy, the current recommendations are managing symptoms, with lifestyle management and supportive care. This paper provides an outline of strategies that young people and their families have reported as helpful in managing a chronic illness that impacts their life socially, physically, emotionally, cognitively and educationally. As the illness frequently occurs at a time of rapid developmental changes, reducing these impacts is reported to be as important as managing the physical symptoms. Young people face a mean duration of 5 years illness (range 1-16 years) with a likely residual 20% having significant restrictions after 10 years. Their feedback has suggested that symptom management, self-management strategies, advocacy and educational liaison have been the most helpful. They value professionals who will listen and take them seriously, and after excluding alternative diagnoses, they explain the diagnosis, are supportive and assist in monitoring their progress. Remaining engaged in education was the best predictor of later functioning. This allowed for social connections, as well as potential independence and fulfilling some aspirations. The need to consider the impact of this chronic illness on all aspects of adolescent development, as part of management, is highlighted.",

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the clinical and endoscopic data of 96 adult CD patients treated in the Department of Gastroenterology of the People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region from March 2016 to December 2021 were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 96 CD patients were diagnosed, including 33 men and 63 women. The average age was 47\u00b114 years (range, 18-81 years). The disease occurred mainly in the age group of 31-60 years. The median course of the disease was 2.0 (0.2-40.0) years. There were 41 (42.7%) classical and 55 (57.3%) non-classical CD patients. All patients with classical CD showed chronic diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal pain (46.3%, 19/41), abdominal distension (17.1%, 7/41), anemia (65.9%, 27/41), and chronic fatigue (48.8%, 20/41). The main manifestations of non-classical CD were chronic abdominal pain (58.2%, 32/55), abdominal distension (32.7%, 18/55), anemia (40.0%, 22/55), and osteopenia/osteoporosis (38.2%, 21/55). Compared with non-classical CD, anemia developed more frequently in classical CD, and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.012). The incidence of complications in CD patients was 36.5% (35/96), and the main complications were thyroid disease (19.8%, 19/96), connective tissue disease (6.2%, 6/96), and kidney disease (6.2%, 6/96). There was no significant difference between classical and non-classical CD (P>0.05). The frequency of endoscopic manifestations in CD patients was 84.4% (81/96). Duodenal bulb endoscopy showed nodular changes (72.9%, 70/96), grooved changes (10.4%, 10/96), and focal villous atrophy (9.4%, 9/96).

Conclusions: Adult CD patients are mostly female. CD occurred mainly in the age group of 31-60 years. The clinical manifestations were mainly those of non-classical CD. Some patients often had other autoimmune diseases. Patients with characteristic endoscopic manifestations should be warned about the possibility of developing CD. Clinicians should strengthen the understanding of CD and reduce the related rates of missed diagnosis.",

In this review, all data published on an imbalance of autoantibodies against GPCR, clinical symptoms and pathogenic mechanisms in CFS, Fibromyalgia, SBIs, COVID and PCS, SBS, POTS, and some autoimmune diseases were analyzed. Possible criteria to diagnose the autoimmune autonomic nervous system imbalance were created.",

        "abstract": "A growing number of individuals report prolonged symptoms following acute Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection, known as post-COVID-19 condition (post-COVID-19). While studies have emerged investigating the symptom sequelae of post-COVID-19, there has been limited investigation into the characterization of pain, fatigue, and function in these individuals, despite initial reports of a clinical phenotype similar to fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). This study aimed to characterize multiple symptom domains in individuals reporting post-COVID-19 and compare its clinical phenotype with those with FMS and CFS. A total of 707 individuals with a single or comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19, FMS, and/or CFS completed multiple surveys assessing self-reported pain, fatigue, physical and cognitive function, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety, depression, dyspnea, and sleep quality. In all 3 diagnoses, elevated pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia were reported. Physical and cognitive function were similarly impacted among individuals with post-COVID-19, FMS, and CFS; however, individuals with post-COVID-19 reported lower pain and fatigue than FMS and CFS. The comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19 with FMS and/or CFS further exacerbated pain, fatigue, and psychological domains when compared with post-COVID-19 alone. In summary, individuals with post-COVID-19 report a symptom phenotype similar to FMS and CFS, negatively impacting cognitive and physical function, but with less severe pain and fatigue overall. These findings may help direct future investigations of the benefit of a biopsychosocial approach to the clinical management of post-COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A meaningful part of schizophrenia patients suffer from physiosomatic symptoms (formerly named psychosomatic), which are reminiscent of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia (FF) and are associated with signs of immune activation and increased levels of tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). AIMS: The study aims to examine whether FF symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with the breakdown of the paracellular pathway, zonulin, lowered natural IgM responses to oxidative specific epitopes (OSEs); and whether FF symptoms belong to the behavioral-cognitive-physical-psychosocial- (BCPS)-worsening index consisting of indices of a general cognitive decline (G-CoDe), symptomatome of schizophrenia, and quality of life (QoL)-phenomenome. METHODS: FF symptoms were assessed using the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Rating scale in 80 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls and serum cytokines/chemokines, IgA levels to TRYCATs, IgM to OSEs, zonulin and transcellular/paracellular (TRANS/PARA) molecules were assayed using ELISA methods. RESULTS: A large part (42.3%) of the variance in the total FF score was explained by the regression on the PARA/TRANS ratio, pro-inflammatory cytokines, IgM to zonulin, IgA to TRYCATs (all positively), and IgM to OSEs (inversely). There were highly significant correlations between the total FF score and G-CoDe, symtopmatome, QoL phenomenome, and BCPS-worsening score. FF symptoms belong to a common core shared by G-CoDe, symtopmatome, and QoL phenomenome. CONCLUSION: The physio-somatic symptoms of schizophrenia are driven by various pathways, including increased zonulin, breakdown of the paracellular tight-junctions pathway, immune activation with induction of the TRYCAT pathway, and consequent neurotoxicity. It is concluded that FF symptoms are part of the phenome of schizophrenia and BCPS-worsening as well.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms and glomerular filtration rate, inflammatory biomarkers, and Wnt/cateninpathway proteins. METHODS: The Wnt-pathway related proteins \u03b2-catenin, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), R-spondin- 1, and sclerostin were measured by ELISA technique in 60 ESRD patients and 30 controls. The Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of FF symptoms. RESULTS: ESRD is characterized by a significant increase in the total FF score, muscle tension, fatigue, sadness, sleep disorders, gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, and a flu-like malaise. The total-FF score was significantly correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, and copper (positively), and \u03b2-catenin, eGFR, hemoglobin, albumin, and zinc (inversely). The total-FF score was associated with the number of total dialysis and weekly dialysis sessions, and these dialysis characteristics were more important in predicting FF scores than eGFR measurements. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the FF score comprised two factors that are differently associated with biomarkers: a) 43.0% of the variance in fatigue, GI symptoms, muscle tension, sadness, and insomnia is explained by hemoglobin, albumin, zinc, \u03b2-catenin, and R-spondin-1; and b) 22.3% of the variance in irritability, concentration and memory impairments by increased copper and cations/chloride ratio, and male sex. CONCLUSION: ESRD patients show high levels of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms associated with hemodialysis and mediated by dialysis-induced changes in inflammatory pathways, the Wnt/catenin pathway, and copper.",

Data available do not allow us to define the usefulness of physical activity to attenuate long COVID-19 functional modifications. The present observational study investigates the effects of physical activity on the perception of fatigue, maximum power output, sleep, and cognitive modifications in subjects affected by long COVID-19, distinguishing between active and sedentary subjects. The data demonstrated the following: the perception of fatigue 1 year after the end of virus positivity was significantly reduced with respect to that observed after 6 months by more than 50% more in active subjects compared to sedentary ones; 6 months after the end of virus positivity, the force developed by active subjects was reduced (RM factor: p < 0.001, \u03b72p = 0.527, post hoc: p < 0.001), but the reduction was more pronounced in sedentary ones (mean difference = 38.499 W); poor sleep quality and mild cognitive impairment were assessed in both active and sedentary subjects. In conclusion, the study suggests that the long COVID-19 fatigue was lower in active subjects respect to sedentary ones. A comparative analysis performed due to the overlap of functional alterations between long COVID-19 and ME/CFS showed that in a small percentage of the enrolled subjects (8%), the symptomatology reflected that of ME/CFS and was independent of the individual physical capacities.",

        "abstract": "(1) Background: The safety of medicines has been receiving increased attention to ensure that the risks of taking medicines do not outweigh the benefits. This is the reason why, over several decades, the pharmacovigilance system has been developed. The post-authorization pharmacovigilance system is based on reports from healthcare professionals and patients on observed adverse reactions. The reports are collected in databases and progressively evaluated. However, there are emerging concerns about the effectiveness of the established passive pharmacovigilance system in accelerating circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, when billions of doses of new vaccines were administered without a long history of use. Currently, health professionals receive fragmented new information on the safety of medicines from competent authorities after a lengthy evaluation process. Simultaneously, in the context of accelerated mass vaccination, health professionals need to have access to operational information-at least on organ systems at higher risk. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a primary data analysis of publicly available data on suspected COVID-19 vaccine-related adverse reactions in Europe, in order to identify the predominant groups of reported medical conditions after vaccination and their association with vaccine groups, as well as to evaluate the data accessibility on specific syndromes. (2) Methods: To achieve the objectives, the data publicly available in the EudraVigilance European Database for Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction Reports were analyzed. The following tasks were defined to: (1) Identify the predominant groups of medical conditions mentioned in adverse reaction reports; (2) determine the relative frequency of reports within vaccine groups; (3) assess the feasibility of obtaining information on a possibly associated syndrome-myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). (3) Results: The data obtained demonstrate that the predominant medical conditions induced after vaccination are relevant to the following categories: (1) \"General disorders and administration site conditions\", (2) \"nervous system disorders\", and (3) \"musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders\". There are more reports for mRNA vaccines, but the relative frequency of reports per dose administered, is lower for this group of vaccines. Information on ME/CFS was not available, but reports of \"chronic fatigue syndrome\" are included in the database and accessible for primary analysis. (4) Conclusions: The information obtained on the predominantly reported medical conditions and the relevant vaccine groups may be useful for health professionals, patients, researchers, and medicine manufacturers. Policymakers could benefit from reflecting on the design of an active pharmacovigilance model, making full use of modern information technologies, including big data analysis of social media and networks for the detection of primary signals and building an early warning system.",

        "abstract": "Following COVID-19 infection, a substantial proportion of patients suffer from persistent symptoms known as Long COVID. Among the main symptoms are fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, muscle weakness and orthostatic intolerance (OI). These symptoms also occur in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue (ME/CFS). OI is highly prevalent in ME/CFS and develops early during or after acute COVID-19 infection. The causes for OI are unknown and autonomic dysfunction is hypothetically assumed to be the primary cause, presumably as a consequence of neuroinflammation. Here, we propose an alternative, primary vascular mechanism as the underlying cause of OI in Long COVID. We assume that the capacitance vessel system, which plays a key role in physiologic orthostatic regulation, becomes dysfunctional due to a disturbance of the microvessels and the vasa vasorum, which supply large parts of the wall of those large vessels. We assume that the known microcirculatory disturbance found after COVID-19 infection, resulting from endothelial dysfunction, microthrombus formation and rheological disturbances of blood cells (altered deformability), also affects the vasa vasorum to impair the function of the capacitance vessels. In an attempt to compensate for the vascular deficit, sympathetic activity overshoots to further worsen OI, resulting in a vicious circle that maintains OI. The resulting orthostatic stress, in turn, plays a key role in autonomic dysfunction and the pathophysiology of ME/CFS.",

Understanding the genetic (and other) risk factors associated with the disease would begin to help to alleviate some of these issues for patients. METHODS: We applied both GWAS and the PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform to analyze ME/CFS cohorts from UK Biobank, including the Pain Questionnaire cohort, in a case-control design with 1000 cycles of fully random permutation. Results from this study were supported by a series of replication and cohort comparison experiments, including use of disjoint Verbal Interview CFS, post-viral fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia cohorts also derived from UK Biobank, and compared\u00a0results for overlap and reproducibility. RESULTS: Combinatorial analysis revealed 199 SNPs mapping to 14 genes that were significantly associated with 91% of the cases in the ME/CFS population. These SNPs were found to stratify by shared cases into 15 clusters (communities) made up of 84 high-order combinations of between 3 and 5 SNPs. p-values for these communities range from 2.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10 to 1.6\u2009\u00d7\u200910-72. Many of the genes identified are linked to the key cellular mechanisms hypothesized to underpin ME/CFS, including vulnerabilities to stress and/or infection, mitochondrial dysfunction, sleep disturbance and autoimmune development. We identified 3 of the critical SNPs replicated in the post-viral fatigue syndrome cohort and 2 SNPs replicated in the fibromyalgia cohort. We also noted similarities with genes associated with multiple sclerosis and long COVID, which share some symptoms and potentially a viral infection trigger with ME/CFS.

This information is useful when planning services for CYP and families affected by moderate/severe ME/CFS and to guide future management trials and commissioning decisions. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records of the 27 CYP who received ward-based treatment in 2015. Notes were retrospectively reviewed to assess progress in four markers of wellbeing over the period of treatment: (i) mobility, (ii) education, (iii) sleep and (iv) involvement in social/recreational activities.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with symptoms that may be related to myalgic encephalomyelitis and/or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) among children and adolescents. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This substudy of the cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys in Germany (SARS-CoV-2 KIDS) was performed in 9 pediatric hospitals from May 1 to October 31, 2021. Pediatric patients were recruited during an inpatient or outpatient visit regardless of the purpose of the visit. Parental questionnaires and serum samples were collected during clinically indicated blood draws. The parental questionnaire on demographic and clinical information was extended by items according to the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, a pediatric screening tool for ME/CFS in epidemiological studies in patients aged 5 to 17 years. EXPOSURES: Seropositivity was determined by SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Key symptoms of ME/CFS were evaluated separately or as clustered ME/CFS symptoms according to the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, including fatigue. RESULTS: Among 634 participants (294 male [46.4%] and 340 female [53.6%]; median age, 11.5 [IQR, 8-14] years), 198 (31.2%) reported clustered ME/CFS symptoms, including 40 of 100 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive (40.0%) and 158 of 534 SARS-CoV-2-seronegative (29.6%) children and adolescents. After adjustment for sex, age group, and preexisting disease, the risk ratio for reporting clustered ME/CFS symptoms decreased from 1.35 (95% CI, 1.03-1.78) to 1.18 (95% CI, 0.90-1.53) and for substantial fatigue from 2.45 (95% CI, 1.24-4.84) to 2.08 (95% CI, 1.05-4.13). Confinement to children and adolescents with unknown previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status (n\u2009=\u2009610) yielded lower adjusted risks for all symptoms except joint pain ME/CFS-related symptoms. The adjusted risk ratio was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.80-1.46) for reporting clustered ME/CFS symptoms and 1.43 (95% CI, 0.63-3.23) for fatigue. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that the risk of ME/CFS in children and adolescents owing to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be very small. Recall bias may contribute to risk estimates of long COVID-19 symptoms in children. Extensive lockdowns must be considered as an alternative explanation for complex unspecific symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

No data are available on EMG recording of evoked myopotentials (M-waves) or exercise-induced alterations in long-COVID patients, providing evidence of muscle membrane fatigue. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) develops in more than half of patients after an infectious disease, particularly viral diseases. A large proportion (around 70%) of these patients have neuromuscular disorders with M-wave alterations during and after exercise. Our hypothesis was that M-wave alterations would be also found in long-COVID patients, in association with neuromuscular symptoms, similar to ME/CFS. METHODS: This retrospective observational ColGEM (Covid LonG Enc\u00e9phalomyelite Myalgique) study compared 59 patients with long-COVID and 55 ME/CFS patients with a history of severe infection who presented before the COVID pandemic. All of these patients underwent the same protocol consisting of a questionnaire focusing on neural and neuromuscular disorders and M-wave recording in the rectus femoris muscle before, during, and 10\u00a0min after a progressive cycling exercise. Maximal handgrip strength (MHGS) and maximal exercise power were also measured. The frequency of symptoms and magnitude of M-wave changes in the two groups were compared using non-parametric and parametric tests. RESULTS: The frequency of fatigue, myalgia, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise as well as the magnitude of exercise-induced M-wave alterations were the same in the two groups. By contrast, digestive problems were less present in long-COVID. M-wave alterations were greater in ME/CFS patients as in those with long-COVID when the highest muscle strength and highest exercise performance were measured.

Training machine learning algorithms on this antibody-binding data demonstrated that immune responses against gut microbiota represent a unique layer of information beyond standard blood tests, providing improved molecular diagnostics for ME/CFS.

Aside from the primarily targeted respiratory organs, adverse SARS-CoV-2 effects were observed in nervous, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal/metabolic, immune, and other systems in COVID-19 survivors. Long-term effects of this viral infection have been recently observed and represent distressing sequelae recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a distinct clinical entity defined as post-COVID-19 condition. Considering the pandemic is still ongoing, more time is required to confirm post COVID-19 condition diagnosis in the COVID-19 infected cohorts, although many reported post COVID-19 symptoms overlap with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). AIMS OF REVIEW: In this study, COVID-19 clinical presentation and associated post-infection sequelae (post-COVID-19 condition) were reviewed and compared with ME/CFS symptomatology. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: The onset, progression, and symptom profile of post COVID-19 condition patients have considerable overlap with ME/CFS. Considering the large scope and range of pro-inflammatory effects of this virus, it is reasonable to expect development of post COVID-19 clinical complications in a proportion of the affected population. There are reports of a later debilitating syndrome onset three months post COVID-19 infection (often described as long-COVID-19), marked by the presence of fatigue, headache, cognitive dysfunction, post-exertional malaise, orthostatic intolerance, and dyspnoea. Acute inflammation, oxidative stress, and increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), have been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

        "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that platelet-poor plasma (PPP) obtained from patients with Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is characterized by a hypercoagulable state and contains hyperactivated platelets and considerable numbers of already-formed amyloid fibrin(ogen) or fibrinaloid microclots. Due to the substantial overlap in symptoms and etiology between Long COVID/PASC and ME/CFS, we investigated whether coagulopathies reflected in Long COVID/PASC-hypercoagulability, platelet hyperactivation, and fibrinaloid microclot formation-were present in individuals with ME/CFS and gender- and age-matched healthy controls. ME/CFS samples showed significant hypercoagulability as judged by thromboelastography of both whole blood and platelet-poor plasma. The area of plasma images containing fibrinaloid microclots was commonly more than 10-fold greater in untreated PPP from individuals with ME/CFS than in that of healthy controls. A similar difference was found when the plasma samples were treated with thrombin. Using fluorescently labelled PAC-1, which recognizes glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, and CD62P, which binds P-selectin, we observed hyperactivation of platelets in ME/CFS hematocrit samples. Using a quantitative scoring system, the ME/CFS platelets were found to have a mean spreading score of 2.72 \u00b1 1.24 vs. 1.00 (activation with pseudopodia formation) for healthy controls. We conclude that ME/CFS is accompanied by substantial and measurable changes in coagulability, platelet hyperactivation, and fibrinaloid microclot formation. However, the fibrinaloid microclot load was not as great as was previously noted in Long COVID/PASC. Fibrinaloid microclots, in particular, may contribute to many ME/CFS symptoms, such as fatigue, seen in patients with ME/CFS, via the (temporary) blockage of microcapillaries and hence ischemia. Furthermore, fibrinaloid microclots might damage the endothelium. The discovery of these biomarkers represents an important development in ME/CFS research. It also points to possible uses for treatment strategies using known drugs and/or nutraceuticals that target systemic vascular pathology and endothelial inflammation.",

        "title": "Epipharyngeal Abrasive Therapy (EAT) Reduces the mRNA Expression of Major Proinflammatory Cytokine IL-6 in Chronic Epipharyngitis.",
        "abstract": "The epipharynx, located behind the nasal cavity, is responsible for upper respiratory tract immunity; however, it is also the site of frequent acute and chronic inflammation. Previous reports have suggested that chronic epipharyngitis is involved not only in local symptoms such as cough and postnasal drip, but also in systemic inflammatory diseases such as IgA nephropathy and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Long COVID. Epipharyngeal Abrasive Therapy (EAT), which is an effective treatment for chronic epipharyngitis in Japan, is reported to be effective for these intractable diseases. The sedation of chronic epipharyngitis by EAT induces suppression of the inflammatory cytokines and improves systemic symptoms, which is considered to be one of the mechanisms, but there is no report that has proved this hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the anti-inflammatory effect of EAT histologically. The study subjects were 8 patients who were not treated with EAT and 11 patients who were treated with EAT for chronic epipharyngitis for 1 month or more. For immunohistochemical assessment, the expression pattern of IL-6 mRNA, which plays a central role in the human cytokine network, was analyzed using in situ hybridization. The expression of IL-6 in the EAT-treated group was significantly lower than those in the EAT nontreated group (p = 0.0015). In addition, EAT suppressed the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), a crucial proinflammatory cytokine. As a result, continuous EAT suppressed submucosal cell aggregation and reduced inflammatory cytokines. Thus, EAT may contribute to the improvement of systemic inflammatory diseases through the suppression of IL-6 expression.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Better knowledge of long-term symptoms following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the so-called post-COVID-19, in non-hospitalized patients is needed. The aim of this study was to study persisent symptoms up to 12 months after COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients and their impact on work ability. We also investigated predictors of persistent symptoms. METHODS: This study encompassed non-hospitalized adult subjects with a COVID-19 infection confirmed via positive nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test during the first wave of the pandemic in Uppsala, Sweden. In total, 566 subjects were sent a survey via e-mail or post with an invitation to participate in the survey 12 months post-diagnosis. The majority of subjects were healthcare workers, as this group was prioritized for testing. RESULTS: A total of 366 subjects responded, with 47% reporting persistent symptoms 12 months after their COVID-19 diagnosis. The most commonly reported symptoms at this time were impaired sense of smell and/or taste and fatigue. Among the predictors of persistent symptoms were being born abroad, lower physical fitness compared with peers before COVID-19, body mass index >25 kg/m2, cooccurrence of hypertension and chronic pain, and having more than seven of the general COVID-19 symptoms at the onset. Respondents with symptoms after 12 months self-reported negatively about their general health and work ability. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that many people who had mild COVID-19 might have a variety of long-term symptoms. It highlights the importance of considering work ability after mild COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a severe multisystemic condition associated with post-infectious onset, impaired natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and impaired ion channel function, namely Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (TRPM3). Long-term effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has resulted in neurocognitive, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular manifestations recently recognised as post coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) condition. The symptomatology of ME/CFS overlaps significantly with post COVID-19; therefore, this research aimed to investigate TRPM3 ion channel function in post COVID-19 condition patients. METHODS: Whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to measure TRPM3 ion channel activity in isolated NK cells of N\u2009=\u20095 ME/CFS patients, N\u2009=\u20095 post COVID-19 patients, and N\u2009=\u20095 healthy controls (HC). The TRPM3 agonist, pregnenolone sulfate (PregS) was used to activate TRPM3 function, while ononetin was used as a TRPM3 antagonist. RESULTS: As reported in previous research, PregS-induced TRPM3 currents were significantly reduced in ME/CFS patients compared with HC (p\u2009=\u20090.0048). PregS-induced TRPM3 amplitude was significantly reduced in post COVID-19 condition compared with HC (p\u2009=\u20090.0039). Importantly, no significant difference was reported in ME/CFS patients compared with post COVID-19 condition as PregS-induced TRPM3 currents of post COVID-19 condition patients were similar of ME/CFS patients currents (p\u2009>\u20090.9999). Isolated NK cells from post COVID-19 condition and ME/CFS patients were resistant to ononetin and differed significantly with HC (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation suggest that post COVID-19 condition patients may have impaired TRPM3 ion channel function and provide further evidence regarding the similarities between post COVID-19 condition and ME/CFS. Impaired TRPM3 channel activity in post COVID-19 condition patients suggest impaired ion mobilisation which may consequently impede cell function resulting in chronic post-infectious symptoms. Further investigation into TRPM3 function may elucidate the pathomechanism, provide a diagnostic and therapeutic target for post COVID-19 condition patients and commonalities with ME/CFS patients.",

        "abstract": "A proportion of COVID-19 reconvalescent patients develop post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) including a subgroup fulfilling diagnostic criteria of Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (PCS/CFS). Recently, endothelial dysfunction (ED) has been demonstrated in these patients, but the mechanisms remain elusive. Therefore, we investigated the effects of patients' sera on endothelia cells (ECs) in vitro. PCS (n = 17), PCS/CFS (n = 13), and healthy controls (HC, n = 14) were screened for serum anti-endothelial cell autoantibodies (AECAs) and dysregulated cytokines. Serum-treated ECs were analysed for the induction of activation markers and the release of small molecules by flow cytometry. Moreover, the angiogenic potential of sera was measured in a tube formation assay. While only marginal differences between patient groups were observed for serum cytokines, AECA binding to ECs was significantly increased in PCS/CFS patients. Surprisingly, PCS and PCS/CFS sera reduced surface levels of several EC activation markers. PCS sera enhanced the release of molecules associated with vascular remodelling and significantly promoted angiogenesis in vitro compared to the PCS/CFS and HC groups. Additionally, sera from both patient cohorts induced the release of molecules involved in inhibition of nitric oxide-mediated endothelial relaxation. Overall, PCS and PCS/CFS patients' sera differed in their AECA content and their functional effects on ECs, i.e., secretion profiles and angiogenic potential. We hypothesise a pro-angiogenic effect of PCS sera as a compensatory mechanism to ED which is absent in PCS/CFS patients.",

A\u00a0doubling of cases of ME/CFS within the next years is therefore projected. OBJECTIVES: Presentation of the current state of knowledge on ME/CFS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unsystematic review of the literature and of own contributions in research and patient care. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ME/CFS is a\u00a0neuroimmunological disease, mostly infection-induced, usually persisting throughout life. Clinically it is characterized by fatigue lasting at least 6\u00a0months and the defining core feature of exercise intolerance (post-exertional malaise, PEM). Exercise intolerance is defined as a\u00a0worsening of symptoms after (even mild) everyday exertion, which usually begins after several hours or on the following day, is still noticeable at least 14\u00a0h after exertion, and often lasts for several days (up to weeks or longer). Furthermore, ME/CFS is characterized by pain, disturbances of sleep, thinking and memory, and dysregulation of the circulatory, endocrine, and immune systems. As a\u00a0separate clinical entity, ME/CFS should be distinguished from chronic fatigue, which occurs as a\u00a0symptom of a\u00a0range of very different diseases. The diagnosis of ME/CFS is made clinically using established international diagnostic criteria and requires careful stepwise diagnosis to exclude other diagnoses.

Big data, or the collection of vast quantities of data that can be mined for information, have transformed the understanding of many complex illnesses, such as cancer and multiple sclerosis, by dissecting heterogeneity, identifying subtypes, and enabling the development of personalized treatments. It is possible that big data can reveal the same for ME/CFS. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the protocol for the You + ME Registry, present preliminary results related to participant enrollment and satisfaction, and discuss the limitations of the registry as well as next steps. METHODS: We developed and launched the You + ME Registry to collect longitudinal health data from people with ME/CFS, people with long COVID (LC), and control volunteers using rigorous protocols designed to harmonize with other groups collecting data from similar groups of people. RESULTS: As of September 30, 2021, the You + ME Registry had over 4200 geographically diverse participants (3033/4339, 69.9%, people with ME/CFS; 833/4339, 19.2%, post-COVID-19 people; and 473/4339, 10.9%, control volunteers), with an average of 72 new people registered every week. It has qualified as \"great\" using a net promotor score, indicating registrants are likely to recommend the registry to a friend.

In the context of the pandemic, increased attention has been focused on acute measures, but the ending of the pandemic is expected as a resolution of the related healthcare problems. However, there are several indicators that the COVID-19 pandemic might induce long-term consequences for individual and public health. Some of the consequences are inferred and predictable, but there are also areas of medicine that have been indirectly affected by the pandemic, and these consequences have not yet been sufficiently explored.

There are multiple possible etiologies for ME/CFS, among which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in abnormal energy metabolism. The potential of many substances for the treatment of ME/CFS has been examined; however, satisfactory outcomes have not yet been achieved. The development of new substances for curative, not symptomatic, treatments is desired. Molecular hydrogen (H2) ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction by scavenging hydroxyl radicals, the most potent oxidant among reactive oxygen species. Animal experiments and clinical trials reported that H2 exerted ameliorative effects on acute and chronic fatigue. Therefore, we conducted a literature review on the mechanism by which H2 improves acute and chronic fatigue in animals and healthy people and showed that the attenuation of mitochondrial dysfunction by H2 may be involved in the ameliorative effects. Although further clinical trials are needed to determine the efficacy and mechanism of H2 gas in ME/CFS, our literature review suggested that H2 gas may be an effective medical gas for the treatment of ME/CFS.",

We have established a COVID-19 aftercare clinic (CAC) to provide care for an increasing number of these patients. Here, we report the case of a 36-year-old man who developed post-COVID fatigue after acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the acute phase of COVID-19, the patient's fever resolved within four days; however, general fatigue persisted for three months, and he visited our CAC 99 days after the initial infection. Examination revealed a high Aging Male's Symptoms (AMS) score of 44 and low free testosterone (FT) level of 5.5 pg/mL, which meet the Japanese criteria of late-onset hypogonadism (LOH) syndrome. Imaging studies revealed an atrophic pituitary in addition to fatty liver and low bone mineral density. Anterior pituitary function tests showed a low follicle-stimulating hormonelevel and delayed reaction of luteinizing hormone (LH) after gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation, indicating the possibility of hypothalamic hypogonadism in addition to primary hypogonadism seen in patients with post-COVID-19 conditions. After the initiation of Japanese traditional medicine (Kampo medicine: hochuekkito followed by juzentaihoto), the patient's symptoms as well as his AMS score and serum FT level were noticeably improved. Furthermore, follow-up tests of GnRH stimulation revealed improvements in LH responsiveness. Although many patients have been reported to meet the criteria of ME/CFS such as our case, we emphasize the possibility of other underlying pathologies including LOH syndrome.

        "abstract": "Dyspnea, shortness of breath, and chest pain are frequent symptoms of post-COVID syndrome (PCS). These symptoms are unrelated to organ damage in most patients after mild acute COVID infection. Hyperventilation has been identified as a cause of exercise-induced dyspnea in PCS. Since there is a broad overlap in symptomatology with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), causes for dyspnea and potential consequences can be deduced by a stringent application of assumptions made for ME/CFS in our recent review papers. One of the first stimuli of respiration in exercise is caused by metabolic feedback via skeletal muscle afferents. Hyperventilation in PCS, which occurs early on during exercise, can arise from a combined disturbance of a poor skeletal muscle energetic situation and autonomic dysfunction (overshooting respiratory response), both found in ME/CFS. The exaggerated respiratory response aggravating dyspnea does not only limit the ability to exercise but further impairs the muscular energetic situation: one of the buffering mechanisms to respiratory alkalosis is a proton shift from intracellular to extracellular space via the sodium-proton-exchanger subtype 1 (NHE1), thereby loading cells with sodium. This adds to two other sodium loading mechanisms already operative, namely glycolytic metabolism (intracellular acidosis) and impaired Na+/K+ATPase activity. High intracellular sodium has unfavorable effects on mitochondrial calcium and metabolism via sodium-calcium-exchangers (NCX). Mitochondrial calcium overload by high intracellular sodium reversing the transport mode of NCX to import calcium is a key driver for fatigue and chronification. Prevention of hyperventilation has a therapeutic potential by keeping intracellular sodium below the threshold where calcium overload occurs.",

Left ventricular ejection fraction was 59%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09%. Peak VO2 averaged 20.3 \u00b1 7\u00a0mL/kg/min (77% \u00b1 21% predicted VO2). VE/VCO2 slope was 30 \u00b1 7. PetCO2 at rest was 33.5 \u00b1 4.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg. Twenty-four patients (58.5%) had a peak VO2\u00a0<80% predicted. All patients with peak VO2\u00a0<80% had a circulatory limitation to exercise. Fifteen of 17 patients with normal peak VO2 had ventilatory abnormalities including peak respiratory rate >55 (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or dysfunctional breathing (n\u00a0=\u00a012). For the whole cohort, 88% of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a036) had ventilatory abnormalities with dysfunctional breathing (n\u00a0=\u00a026), increased VE/VCO2 (n\u00a0=\u00a017), and/or hypocapnia PetCO2\u00a0<35 (n\u00a0=\u00a025). Nineteen patients (46%) met criteria for ME/CFS. CONCLUSIONS: Circulatory impairment, abnormal ventilatory pattern, and ME/CFS are common in patients with PASC. The dysfunctional breathing, resting hypocapnia, and ME/CFS may contribute to symptoms. CPET is a valuable tool to assess these patients.",

        "abstract": "The findings of controlled trials on use of intravenous immunoglobulin G (IV IgG) to treat myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are generally viewed as representing mixed results. On detailed review, a clearer picture emerges, which suggests that the potential therapeutic value of this intervention has been underestimated. Our analysis is consistent with the propositions that: (1) IgG is highly effective for a proportion of patients with severe and well-characterised ME/CFS; (2) responders can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on markers of immune dysfunction. Rigorous steps were taken in the research trials to record adverse events, with transient symptom exacerbation commonly experienced in both intervention and placebo control groups, suggesting that this reflected the impact of participation on people with an illness characterised by post-exertional symptom exacerbation. Worsening of certain specific symptoms, notably headache, did occur more commonly with IgG and may have been concomitant to effective treatment, being associated with clinical improvement. The findings emerging from this review are supported by clinical observations relating to treatment of patients with severe and very severe ME/CFS, for whom intramuscular and subcutaneous administration provide alternative options. We conclude that: (1) there is a strong case for this area of research to be revived; (2) pending further research, clinicians would be justified in offering a course of IgG to selected ME/CFS patients at the more severe end of the spectrum. As the majority of trial participants had experienced an acute viral or viral-like onset, we further suggest that IgG treatment may be pertinent to the care of some patients who remain ill following infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

The purpose of this review and analysis was to determine the efficacy of various interventions upon the inflammatory markers most affected by COVID-19. The focus was on the markers associated with COVID-19, not the etiology of the virus itself. METHODS: Based on 27 reviewed papers, information was extracted on the effects of COVID-19 upon inflammatory markers, then the effects of standard treatments (Remdesivir, Tocilizumab) and adjunctive interventions (vitamin D3, melatonin, and meditation) were extracted for those markers. These data were used to approximate effect sizes for the disease or interventions via standardized mean differences (SMD). RESULTS: The data that were available indicated that adjunctive interventions affected 68.4% of the inflammatory markers impacted by COVID-19, while standard pharmaceutical medication affected 26.3%. DISCUSSION: Nonstandard adjunctive care appeared to have comparable or superior effects in comparison to Remdesivir and Tocilizumab on the inflammatory markers most impacted by COVID-19.

METHODS: We used a comparison group of 502 patients diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Participants completed a standardized symptom questionnaire and a list of additional CDC COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Over time, the long-haulers reported an overall reduction of most symptoms including unrefreshing sleep and post-exertional malaise, but an intensification of neurocognitive symptoms. When compared to ME/CFS, the COVID-19 sample was initially more symptomatic for the immune and orthostatic domains but over time, the long-haulers evidenced significantly less severe symptoms than those with ME/CFS, except in the orthostatic domain. Among the COVID-19 long haulers, several neurocognitive symptoms got worse over time, whereas improvements occurred in most other areas.

        "title": "Shadow Burden of Undiagnosed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) on Society: Retrospective and Prospective-In Light of COVID-19.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a poorly understood, complex, multisystem disorder, with severe fatigue not alleviated by rest, and other symptoms, which lead to substantial reductions in functional activity and quality of life. Due to the unclear aetiology, treatment of patients is complicated, but one of the initial problems is the insufficient diagnostic process. The increase in the number of undiagnosed ME/CFS patients became specifically relevant in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this research was to investigate the issues of undiagnosed potential ME/CFS patients, with a hypothetical forecast of the expansion of post-viral CFS as a consequence of COVID-19 and its burden on society. METHODS: The theoretical research was founded on the estimation of classic factors presumably affecting the diagnostic scope of ME/CFS and their ascription to Latvian circumstances, as well as a literature review to assess the potential interaction between ME/CFS and COVID-19 as a new contributing agent. The empirical study design consisted of two parts: The first part was dedicated to a comparison of the self-reported data of ME/CFS patients with those of persons experiencing symptoms similar to ME/CFS, but without a diagnosis. This part envisaged the creation of an assumption of the ME/CFS shadow burden \"status quo\", not addressing the impact of COVID-19. The second part aimed to investigate data from former COVID-19 patients' surveys on the presence of ME/CFS symptoms, 6 months after being affected by COVID-19. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: The received data assumed that the previously obtained data on the ME/CFS prevalence of 0.8% in the Latvian population are appropriate, and the literature review reports a prevalence of 0.2-1.0% in developed countries. Regarding the reciprocity of ME/CFS and COVID-19, the literature review showed a lack of research in this field. The empirical results show quite similar self-esteem among ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients with longstanding disease experience, while former COVID-19 patients show a significantly lower severity of these problems. Notably, \"psychological distress (anxiety)\" and \"episodic fatigue\" are significantly predominant symptoms reported by former COVID-19 patients in comparison with ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our analysis predict that the total amount of direct medical costs for undiagnosed patients (out-of-pocket payments) is more than EUR 15 million p.a. (in Latvia), and this may increase by at least 15% due to the consequences of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: ME/CFS creates a significant shadow burden on society, even considering only the direct medical costs of undiagnosed patients-the number of whom in Latvia is probably at least five times higher than the number of discerned patients. Simultaneously, COVID-19 can induce long-lasting complications and chronic conditions, such as post-viral CFS, and increase this burden. The Latvian research data assume that ME/CFS patients are not a high-risk group for COVID-19; however, COVID-19 causes ME/CFS-relevant symptoms in patients. This increases the need for monitoring of patients for even longer after recovering from COVID-19's symptoms, in order to prevent complications and the progression of chronic diseases. In the context of further epidemiological uncertainty, and the possibility of severe post-viral consequences, preventive measures are becoming significantly more important; an integrated diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment could reduce this burden in the future.",

For two decades, the medical education establishment in the UK has been challenged to remedy these failings, but little has changed. Meanwhile, there has been an exponential increase in biomedical research and an international paradigm shift in the literature, which defines ME/CFS as a multisystem disease, replacing the psychogenic narrative. This study was designed to explore the current UK medical school education on ME/CFS and to identify challenges and opportunities relating to future ME/CFS medical education. Materials and methods: A questionnaire, developed under the guidance of the Medical Schools Council, was sent to all 34 UK medical schools to collect data for the academic year 2018-2019. Results: Responses were provided by 22 out of a total of 34 medical schools (65%); of these 13/22 (59%) taught ME/CFS, and teaching was led by lecturers from ten medical specialties. Teaching delivery was usually by lecture; discussion, case studies and e-learning were also used. Questions on ME/CFS were included by seven schools in their examinations and three schools reported likely clinical exposure to ME/CFS patients. Two-thirds of respondents were interested in receiving further teaching aids in ME/CFS. None of the schools shared details of their teaching syllabus, so it was not possible to ascertain what the students were being taught. Conclusions: This exploratory study reveals inadequacies in medical school teaching on ME/CFS. Many medical schools (64% of respondents) acknowledge the need to update ME/CFS education by expressing an appetite for further educational materials. The General Medical Council (GMC) and Medical Schools Council (MSC) are called upon to use their considerable influence to bring about the appropriate changes to medical school curricula so future doctors can recognise, diagnose and treat ME/CFS.

Based on the scientific literature and our clinical/research experiences, we identify risk and protective factors and provide a guide to assessing and managing suicidality in an outpatient medical setting. A clinical case is used to illustrate how information from this article can be applied. Characteristics of ME/CFS that make addressing suicidality challenging include absence of any disease-modifying treatments, severe functional limitations, and symptoms which limit therapies. Decades-long misattribution of ME/CFS to physical deconditioning or psychiatric disorders have resulted in undereducated healthcare professionals, public stigma, and unsupportive social interactions. Consequently, some patients may be reluctant to engage with mental health care. Outpatient medical professionals play a vital role in mitigating these effects. By combining evidence-based interventions aimed at all suicidal patients with those adapted to individual patients' circumstances, suffering and suicidality can be alleviated in ME/CFS.

The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3\u2009weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS.

        "abstract": "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or Myalgic Encephaloymelitis (ME/CFS) is a frequent debilitating disease with an enigmatic etiology. The finding of autoantibodies against \u00df2-adrenergic receptors (\u00df2AdR) prompted us to hypothesize that \u00df2AdR dysfunction is of critical importance in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS. Our hypothesis published previously considers ME/CFS as a disease caused by a dysfunctional autonomic nervous system (ANS) system: sympathetic overactivity in the presence of vascular dysregulation by \u00df2AdR dysfunction causes predominance of vasoconstrictor influences in brain and skeletal muscles, which in the latter is opposed by the metabolically stimulated release of endogenous vasodilators (functional sympatholysis). An enigmatic bioenergetic disturbance in skeletal muscle strongly contributes to this release. Excessive generation of these vasodilators with algesic properties and spillover into the systemic circulation could explain hypovolemia, suppression of renin (paradoxon) and the enigmatic symptoms. In this hypothesis paper the mechanisms underlying the energetic disturbance in muscles will be explained and merged with the first hypothesis. The key information is that \u00df2AdR also stimulates the Na+/K+-ATPase in skeletal muscles. Appropriate muscular perfusion as well as function of the Na+/K+-ATPase determine muscle fatigability. We presume that dysfunction of the \u00df2AdR also leads to an insufficient stimulation of the Na+/K+-ATPase causing sodium overload which reverses the transport direction of the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) to import calcium instead of exporting it as is also known from the ischemia-reperfusion paradigm. The ensuing calcium overload affects the mitochondria, cytoplasmatic metabolism and the endothelium which further worsens the energetic situation (vicious circle) to explain postexertional malaise, exercise intolerance and chronification. Reduced Na+/K+-ATPase activity is not the only cause for cellular sodium loading. In poor energetic situations increased proton production raises intracellular sodium via sodium-proton-exchanger subtype-1 (NHE1), the most important proton-extruder in skeletal muscle. Finally, sodium overload is due to diminished sodium outward transport and enhanced cellular sodium loading. As soon as this disturbance would have occurred in a severe manner the threshold for re-induction would be strongly lowered, mainly due to an upregulated NHE1, so that it could repeat at low levels of exercise, even by activities of everyday life, re-inducing mitochondrial, metabolic and vascular dysfunction to perpetuate the disease.",

An online flash survey was conducted during the containment period in partnership with French Patients Organizations including ME/CFS national association. Therefore, 'Brief COPE' version of Lazarus and Folkman's Ways of Coping Check List has been adapted to the specificity of the containment.

The latter have significantly different coping strategies than recognised diagnosed diseases patients: similar uses of emotion focused coping but less uses of seek social support and problem-focused copings. In conclusion, coping strategies are different for those who deal with the daily experience of ME/CFS, highly disabling chronic condition with diagnostic ambiguity, low degree of medical and social recognition and without treatment.

        "abstract": "The potential benefits of the scientific insights gleaned from years of treating ME/CFS for the emerging symptoms of COVID-19, and in particular Longhaul- or Longhauler-COVID-19 are discussed in this opinion article. Longhaul COVID-19 is the current name being given to the long-term sequelae (symptoms lasting beyond 6 weeks) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multiple case definitions for ME/CFS exist, but post-exertional malaise (PEM) is currently emerging as the 'hallmark' symptom. The inability to identify a unique trigger of ME/CFS, as well as the inability to identify a specific, diagnostic laboratory test, led many physicians to conclude that the illness was psychosomatic or non-existent. However, recent research in the US and the UK, championed by patient organizations and their use of the internet and social media, suggest underlying pathophysiologies, e.g., oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The similarity and overlap of ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 symptoms suggest to us similar pathological processes. We put forward a unifying hypothesis that explains the precipitating events such as viral triggers and other documented exposures: For their overlap in symptoms, ME/CFS and Longhaul COVID-19 should be described as Post Active Phase of Infection Syndromes (PAPIS). We further propose that the underlying biochemical pathways and pathophysiological processes of similar symptoms are similar regardless of the initiating trigger.

        "abstract": "Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by severe and disabling fatigue that fails to improve with rest; it is commonly accompanied by multifocal pain, as well as sleep disruption, and cognitive dysfunction. Even mild exertion can exacerbate symptoms. The prevalence of ME/CFS in the U.S. is estimated to be 0.5-1.5 % and is higher among females. Viral infection is an established trigger for the onset of ME/CFS symptoms, raising the possibility of an increase in ME/CFS prevalence resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatments are largely palliative and limited to alleviating symptoms and addressing the psychological sequelae associated with long-term disability. While ME/CFS is characterized by broad heterogeneity, common features include immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanistic basis of the disease remains poorly understood. Herein, we review the current understanding, diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS and summarize past clinical studies aimed at identifying effective therapies. We describe the current status of mechanistic studies, including the identification of multiple targets for potential pharmacological intervention, and ongoing efforts towards the discovery of new medicines for ME/CFS treatment.",

        "abstract": "An increasing number of young and previously fit and healthy people who did not require hospitalisation continue to have symptoms months after mild cases of COVID-19. Rehabilitation clinics are already offering cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an effective treatment for long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome based on the claims that it is effective for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)-the most common post-infectious syndrome-as no study into the efficacy of CBT for post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome has been published. Re-analyses of these studies, however, showed that CBT did not lead to objective improvements in heterogeneous groups of ME/CFS patients, nor did it restore the ability to work. The group of patients with long COVID and post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome, on the other hand, is homogeneous. We therefore analysed the Dutch Qure study, as it studied the efficacy of CBT in a homogeneous group of patients who developed Q-fever fatigue syndrome-which affects up to 30% of patients-after the largest reported outbreak of Q-fever, to see if CBT might potentially be an effective treatment for long-haulers after COVID-19 infection. Our reanalysis found that the Qure study suffered from many serious methodological problems, which included relying on one subjective primary outcome in a study without a control group for the non-blinded CBT treatment group, using a post hoc definition of improvement, waiting 2 years before publishing their objective actometer results and ignoring the null effect of said results. Moreover, only 10% of participants achieved a clinically meaningful subjective improvement in fatigue as a result of CBT according to the study's own figures. Consequently, CBT has no subjective clinically meaningful effect in nine out of every ten patients that are treated with it. Additionally, the subjective improvement in fatigue was not matched by an improvement in disability, even though the disability was fatigue related according to the researchers. On top of this, CBT did not lead to an objective improvement in physical performance. Therefore, it cannot be said that CBT is an effective treatment for Q-fever fatigue syndrome either. It seems therefore unlikely that CBT will reduce disability or lead to objective improvement in long COVID or in post-COVID-19 fatigue syndrome.",

We retrospectively evaluated the plasmatic levels of both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25 OH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25 OH), the active and storage forms of vitamin-D3, respectively, in the serum of gynecologic cancer patients affected by PASC/LC vs control cancer patients. We found elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D levels in 5 out of 5 of the PASC/LC patients (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a097.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026.9\u00a0pg/mL) versus 0 out of 10 of randomly selected cancer control patients (44.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.2\u00a0pg/mL, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005).

Importantly, abnormal levels of vitamin D were found to persist for at least 2\u00a0years in patients with long covid symptoms. The active form (1,25OH) but not the storage form (25 OH) of vitamin-D is significantly elevated in PASC/LC cancer patients. Abnormally and persistently elevated 1,25OH levels, similarly to sarcoidosis patients, may represent the results of extrarenal conversion of vitamin D by activated macrophages, and a novel biomarker of persistent inflammation in gynecologic cancer patients with PASC/LC.",

Having a low eGFR (<90 ml/min/1.73 m2) before COVID-19 infection, having B-positive blood type, diabetes, taking vitamin C during the acute phase of COVID-19 or suffering from chronic COVID-19 symptoms, were identified as protective factors.

Patients with COVID-19 may experience persistent long-term health issues, known as long COVID. Both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long COVID have resulted in persistent negative impacts on global public health. The effective application and development of blood-derived products are important strategies to combat the serious damage caused by COVID-19. Since the emergence of COVID-19, various blood-derived products that target or do not target SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated for therapeutic applications. SARS-CoV-2-targeting blood-derived products, including COVID-19 convalescent plasma, COVID-19 hyperimmune globulin, and recombinant anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing immunoglobulin G, are virus-targeting and can provide immediate control of viral infection in the short term. Non-SARS-CoV-2-targeting blood-derived products, including intravenous immunoglobulin and human serum albumin exhibit anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anticoagulatory properties. Rational use of these products can be beneficial to patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection or long COVID.

As vaccination becomes widely available and infection rates facilitate herd immunity across the globe, more attention has been given to long-term symptoms that may persist after the index infection, which include impairments in concentration, executive dysfunction, sensory disturbances, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and cough, among other symptoms classified under the umbrella term of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC).Functional neurologic disorder (FND), also known as conversion disorder and functional neurologic symptom disorder, refers to the presence of one or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function that are incompatible with and not better explained by a known neurological or medical condition that causes significant distress and functional impairment. Although the diagnosis of FND may not require the identification of an underlying psychological stressor, being diagnosed with an FND can worsen stigma and shift attention and resources away from other medical concerns that should be concomitantly addressed.This review summarizes the literature on the overlapping nature and discrimination of PASC from FND in COVID-19 survivors. Based on this, we develop a treatment framework that targets unique domains of these complex overlapping presentations, following a multidisciplinary approach with an individualized treatment plan inclusive of physical and psychological interventions focused on functional rehabilitation.",

        "abstract": "This systematic review aimed to assess COVID-19-associated absenteeism among healthcare personnel (HCP). PubMed was searched on 4 February 2023. Inclusion criteria were the presentation of original data on COVID-19-associated absenteeism among HCP. Exclusion criteria were absenteeism associated with burnout, mental health illness, post-COVID syndrome, or child-care. Nineteen articles were identified; fifteen concerned almost exclusively the first pandemic year. Hospitals accounted for most data. There was heterogeneity across studies in terms of presentation of absenteeism data. Before COVID-19 vaccines became available, COVID-19 was a major driver of HCP absenteeism with excess costs, while the mean duration of absenteeism ranged from 5.82 to 33 days per episode of absence. Determinant factors of absenteeism rates were department of employment, high-risk exposure, age, profession, and work experience of HCP, suspected COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 testing, SARS-CoV-2 positivity, and return-to-work strategy. Two studies demonstrated that COVID-19 vaccination significantly reduced the burden of absenteeism. Routine testing of asymptomatic HCP and use of personal protective equipment also significantly ameliorated absenteeism. In conclusion, COVID-19 has been a major driver of HCP absenteeism. Research is needed to assess how COVID-19 will impact HCP in the next years, considering the new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, and the newer COVID-19 vaccines. Networks are needed to survey morbidity and absenteeism among HCP in real-time and guide vaccination policies.",

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who visited our long-COVID outpatients' clinic due to long-COVID symptoms from February 2021 to December 2022. MEASUREMENTS: Total triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin, thyroglobulin, anti-thyroperoxidase, and antithyroglobulin autoantibodies were measured for thyroid assessment. Other hormones measured were growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total testosterone, plasma insulin, and C-peptide. Blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin were also measured. To assess adrenal reserve, an ACTH stimulation test was performed. The fatigue assessment scale (FAS) was used to evaluate fatigue severity. RESULTS: Eighty-four adult patients were included. Overall, 40.5% of the patients had at least one endocrine disorder. These included prediabetes (21.4%), low DHEA-S (21.4%), subclinical hypothyroidism (3.6%), non-specific thyroid function abnormality (7.1%), thyroid autoimmunity (7.1%), low testosterone in males (6.6%), and low IGF-1 (3.6%).

The identification of potential therapeutic targets for Post-COVID-19 Syndrome (PCS) or \"Long-COVID\" that can be utilised to reduce the impact of symptoms, is necessary to support effective rehabilitation. Self-compassion and psychological flexibility are thought to be important constructs to consider when understanding how individuals approach the management of long-term health challenges.

One-hundred and five participants (91 females) who were living with PCS after an acute COVID-19 infection, completed measures to assess PCS physical symptom prevalence as well as measures to assess impact on daily life, self-compassion and psychological flexibility.

The DAG identified the following long-COVID-19 covariates: age, obesity, anxiety, depression, cancer, lifestyle, smoking, and menstrual status. A multivariable logistic model with these covariates indicated that anxiety is the only factor to be significantly associated with long-COVID-19 syndrome, whereas other covariates were confounding factors. There was no significant influence of menopausal status on the long-COVID-19 syndrome. CONCLUSION: Among factors selected by the DAG, only anxiety was significantly associated with the long-COVID-19.

In this Viewpoint we argue that while the parallels between the clinical syndrome experienced by many of those currently labeled as Long COVID and fibromyalgia are strong we should be not too quick to rename the disorder.

RESULTS: The questionnaire was filled out by experts from 35 countries. There are large differences between national systems regarding the recognition of OD and OI: 40% of countries have a list system, 57% a mixed system and one country an open system. In most countries, COVID-19 can be recognised as an OD (57%). In four countries, COVID-19 can be recognised as OI (11%) and in seven countries as either OD or OI (20%). In two countries, there is no recognition possible to date. Thirty-two countries (91%) recognise COVID-19 as OD/OI among healthcare workers. Working in certain jobs is considered proof of occupational exposure in 25 countries, contact with a colleague with confirmed infection in 19 countries, and contact with clients with confirmed infection in 21 countries.

We conducted a cohort study including over 856,840 first COVID-19 cases, 72,422 re-infections and more than 3.1 million first negative-test controls from primary care electronic health records from Spain and the UK (Sept 2020 to Jan 2022 (UK)/March 2022 (Spain)). We characterised post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and identified key symptoms associated with persistent disease. We estimated incidence rates of persisting symptoms in the general population and among COVID-19 patients over time. Subsequently, we investigated which WHO-listed symptoms were particularly differential by comparing their frequency in COVID-19 cases vs. matched test-negative controls. Lastly, we compared persistent symptoms after first infections vs. reinfections.Our study shows that the proportion of COVID-19 cases affected by persistent post-acute COVID-19 symptoms declined over the study period. Risk for altered smell/taste was consistently higher in patients with COVID-19 vs test-negative controls. Persistent symptoms were more common after reinfection than following a first infection. More research is needed into the definition of long COVID, and the effect of interventions to minimise the risk and impact of persistent symptoms.",

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 363,825 Veterans that tested positive for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and September 30, 2022. The primary outcome was the development of PASC 30-180\u00a0days following an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Multivariate logistic regression was utilized to examine factors associated with PASC. RESULTS: Of the 363,825 Veterans included in the analysis, 164,315 (45%) displayed symptoms of PASC. The Veterans in this analysis were predominantly male, non-Hispanic White, under the age of 65 years old, and lived in an urban residence. The strongest predictors for PASC included Non-Hispanic Black or African American race compared to Non-Hispanic White race (aOR=1.14), being between the ages of 50 and 64 compared to ages 50 and below (aOR=1.80), diabetes (aOR=8.46), and severe acute infection (aOR=1.42).

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To (1) assess whether residential rurality/urbanicity was associated with the prevalence of 30- or 90-day long COVID, and (2) evaluate whether differences in long COVID risk factors might explain this potential disparity. METHODS: We used data from the Michigan COVID-19 Recovery Surveillance Study, a population-based probability sample of adults with COVID-19 (n = 4,937). We measured residential rurality/urbanicity using dichotomized Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes (metropolitan, nonmetropolitan). We considered outcomes of 30-day long COVID (illness duration \u226530 days) and 90-day long COVID (illness duration \u226590 days). Using Poisson regression, we estimated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) to compare 30- and 90-day long COVID between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan respondents. Then, we adjusted our model to account for differences between groups in long COVID risk factors (age, sex, acute COVID-19 severity, vaccination status, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, health care access, SARS-CoV-2 variant, and pre-existing conditions). We estimated associations for the full study period (Jan 1, 2020-May 31, 2022), the pre-vaccine era (before April 5, 2021), and the vaccine era (after April 5, 2021). FINDINGS: Compared to metropolitan adults, the prevalence of 30-day long COVID was 15% higher (PR = 1.15 [95% CI: 1.03, 1.29]), and the prevalence of 90-day long COVID was 27% higher (PR = 1.27 [95% CI: 1.09, 1.49]) among nonmetropolitan adults. Adjusting for long COVID risk factors did not reduce disparity estimates in the pre-vaccine era but halved estimates in the vaccine era.

Here we aimed to describe clusters of symptoms in individuals with long COVID and explore the impact of the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) and vaccination on these clusters. METHODS: In a prospective, multi centre cohort study, individuals with symptoms persisting\u2009>\u20094\u00a0weeks from acute COVID-19 were divided into two groups based on timing of acute infection; pre-Alpha VOC, denoted wild type (WT) group and post-Alpha VOC (incorporating alpha and delta dominant periods) denoted VOC group. We used multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and hierarchical clustering in the WT and VOC groups to identify symptom clusters. We then used logistic regression to explore factors associated with individual symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 417 individuals were included in the analysis, 268 in WT and 149 in VOC groups respectively. In both groups MCA identified three similar clusters; a musculoskeletal (MSK) cluster characterised by joint pain and myalgia, a cardiorespiratory cluster and a less symptomatic cluster. Differences in characteristic symptoms were only seen in the cardiorespiratory cluster where a decrease in the frequency of palpitations (10% vs 34% p\u2009=\u20090.008) and an increase in cough (63% vs 17% p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the VOC compared to WT groups was observed. Analysis of the frequency of individual symptoms showed significantly lower frequency of both chest pain (25% vs 39% p\u2009=\u20090.004) and palpitations (12% vs 32% p\u2009<\u20090.001) in the VOC group compared to the WT group. In adjusted analysis being in the VOC group was significantly associated with a lower odds of both chest pain and palpitations, but vaccination was not associated with these symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study suggests changes in long COVID phenotype in individuals infected later in the pandemic, with less palpitations and chest pain reported.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus, one of the main diseases that affects the Brazilian population older than 60 years, is defined as a divergent group of metabolic disorders that present a high level of glycemia (hyperglycemia), causing damage to various organs and systems of the body, including the heart, kidneys, eyes, and nervous system. It is believed that in 2025, in Brazil alone, there will be more than 18.5 million individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is important to know the individuals' quality of life in the context of life and culture. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the demographic, clinical, and quality of life profiles of older adults with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in a university hospital complex in the northern Amazon region. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, exploratory, noninterventional, descriptive, and analytical study using a nonrandom sample of 54 older people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus at the geriatrics outpatient clinic of the medium and high complexity university hospital in the western Brazilian Amazon between 2020 and 2022. We used 3 instruments, namely, a sociodemographic questionnaire, a clinical conditions questionnaire, and Diabetes-39. Qualitative data were described using absolute and relative frequencies. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied, and the z test was used for inferential analysis. SPSS software (version 27) was used for data analysis, and the significance level was 5%. RESULTS: Of the 54 interviewees, the majority were women, married, retired, and had a good quality of life. Of these, 48.1% (n=26) were infected by COVID-19, 61.5% (n=16) of whom progressed to long COVID, presenting with fatigue or muscle weakness. As for the quality of life, the \"social overload\" (P<.001) and \"sexual functioning\" (P<.001) dimensions had with low scores compared to the \"energy and mobility\" (P=.005), \"diabetes control\" (P<.001), and \"anxiety and worry\" (P<.001) dimensions. Quality of life was negatively impacted in the \"anxiety and worry\" dimension. Among those affected by COVID-19, most progressed to long COVID; however, there was a lack of data on this theme in the population of older people with diabetes.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Comorbidities of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)/coronary heart disease (CHD) pose great threats to disease outcomes, yet little is known about their shared pathology. The study aimed to examine whether comorbidities of COVID-19/CHD involved shared genetic pathology, as well as to clarify the shared genetic variants predisposing risks common to COVID-19 severity and CHD risks. METHODS: By leveraging publicly available summary statistics, we assessed the genetically determined causality between COVID-19 and CHD with bidirectional Mendelian randomization. To further quantify the causality contributed by shared genetic variants, we interrogated their genetic correlation with the linkage disequilibrium score regression method. Bayesian colocalization analysis coupled with conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate analysis was applied to decipher the shared causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). FINDINGS: Briefly, we observed that the incident CHD risks post COVID-19 infection were partially determined by shared genetic variants. The shared genetic variants contributed to the causality at a proportion of 0.18 (95% CI 0.18-0.19) to 0.23 (95% CI 0.23-0.24). The SNP (rs10490770) located near LZTFL1 suggested direct causality (SNPs \u2192 COVID-19 \u2192 CHD), and SNPs in ABO (rs579459, rs495828), ILRUN(rs2744961), and CACFD1(rs4962153, rs3094379) may simultaneously influence COVID-19 severity and CHD risks. INTERPRETATION: Five SNPs located near LZTFL1 (rs10490770), ABO (rs579459, rs495828), ILRUN (rs2744961), and CACFD1 (rs4962153, rs3094379) may simultaneously influence their risks. The current study suggested that there may be shared mechanisms predisposing to both COVID-19 severity and CHD risks. Genetic predisposition to COVID-19 is a causal risk factor for CHD, supporting that reducing the COVID-19 infection risk or alleviating COVID-19 severity among those with specific genotypes might reduce their subsequent CHD adverse outcomes. Meanwhile, the shared genetic variants identified may be of clinical implications for identifying the target population who are more vulnerable to adverse CHD outcomes post COVID-19 and may also advance treatments of 'Long COVID-19.'",

Cough and sputum are presented by patients with long COVID during the acute and post-acute phases. This study aimed to identify specific risk factors for cough and sputum in patients with long COVID. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years were enrolled in a multicenter cohort study at 26 medical institutions. Clinical data during hospitalization and patient-reported outcomes after discharge were collected from medical records, paper-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps. RESULTS: At the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups, there were no differences in the incidence rates of wet and dry coughs. In contrast, the proportion of patients presenting sputum without coughing increased over time compared to those with sputum and coughing. Univariate analyses of cough and sputum at all follow-up visits identified intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), smoking, and older age as risk factors for prolonged symptoms. At the 12-month follow-up, persistent cough and sputum were associated with the characteristics of severe COVID-19 based on imaging findings, renal and liver dysfunction, pulmonary thromboembolism, and higher serum levels of LDH, KL-6, and HbA1C. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the severity of acute COVID-19 infection was correlated with prolonged cough and sputum production. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that IMV ventilator management were independent risk factors for prolonged cough and sputum at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a Japanese population with long COVID, prolonged cough and sputum production were closely associated with severe COVID-19. These findings emphasize that a preventive approach including appropriate vaccination and contact precaution and further development of therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 are highly recommended for patients with risk factors for severe infection to avoid persistent respiratory symptoms.",

Through a close reading of journalist Lucy Adams's autobiographical accounts of long COVID, this article explores the interplay between individual illness narratives and the collective narrativizing (or making) of an illness. Our focus on temporality and suffering knits together the phenomenological and the social with the aim of opening up Adams's narrative and ascertaining a deeper understanding of what it means to live with the condition.

After the acute phase of illness, the majority of the patients recover quickly but, in some cases, symptoms can persist for a variable duration, bringing into light another entity known as post-COVID syndrome. The objective was to estimate the burden of various persistent respiratory symptoms and lung function abnormalities among recovered patients of COVID-19 and also to correlate them with initial disease severity, demographic factors and comorbidities. METHODS: Eighty-five post-COVID patients were recruited as per inclusion/exclusion criteria. Detailed history taking, physical examination and spirometry were done in all patients and data were correlated with baseline disease severity. RESULTS: Fatigue and breathlessness were the most common symptoms followed by cough, chest pain and fever. Persistent symptoms and their severity were significantly higher in severe/moderate cases. Spirometry was abnormal in 45.88% of subjects and the most common pattern was restrictive type. It was seen that the likelihood of persistent symptoms and abnormal lung function increased significantly with the severity of COVID-19, age, comorbidities, hospital stay duration and steroid/oxygen therapy. CONCLUSION: The current study estimated the burden and array of various pulmonary sequelae encountered by post-COVID patients and elicited various risk factors associated with their occurrence after recovery from active infection. Awareness of these symptoms/sequelae and their risk factors is necessary for their follow-up and timely management, as the threat of this relatively new virus has still not abated.",

Developing antiviral treatments for SARS-CoV-2 is imperative due to the diminishing immunity of the available vaccines. This study targets the RNA-binding site located in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the N-protein to identify the potential antiviral molecules against SARS-CoV-2. A structure-based repurposing approach identified the twelve high-affinity molecules from FDA-approved drugs, natural products, and the LOPAC1280 compound libraries that precisely bind to the RNA binding site within the NTD. The interaction of these potential antiviral agents with the purified NTD protein was thermodynamically characterized using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). A fluorescence-based plate assay to assess the RNA binding inhibitory activity of small molecules against the NTD has been employed, and the selected compounds exhibited significant RNA binding inhibition with calculated IC50 values ranging from 8.8\u00a0\u03bcM to 15.7\u00a0\u03bcM.

Among these complications, cognitive dysfunction, including memory impairment, has been relatively common observed, impacting executive function and quality of life. To date, no approved treatment exists for this specific complication. Therefore, the present clinical trial aimed to investigate the impact of Donepezil Hydrochloride on post-COVID memory impairment. METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial (Approval ID: IRCT20210816052203N1) was conducted, enrolling 25 patients with post-COVID memory impairment. Participants with a history of hospitalization were randomly assigned to either the drug group (n\u00a0=\u00a010) or the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a015). Memory indices were assessed at baseline, one month, and three months later using the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised test. SPSS software and appropriate statistical tests were employed for data analysis. RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in WMS-R subtest and index scores between the drug and control groups at the 4-week and 12-week follow-up periods. However, within the drug group, there was a notable increase in the visual reproduction I and verbal paired associates II subtests during the specified time intervals. CONCLUSION: While donepezil 5\u00a0mg did not exhibit a significant overall increase in memory scales compared to the control group over time, our findings suggest that this medication may exert a positive effect on specific memory subtests. Further research and exploration are warranted to better understand the potential benefits of donepezil in managing post-COVID-related memory impairment.

In order to evaluate the type and prevalence of perfusion defects, we performed a longitudinal analysis of combined perfusion single-photon emission and low-dose computed tomography (Q-SPECT/CT scan) in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: Consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 (B.1.1.7 variant SARS-CoV-2) and respiratory insufficiency underwent chest Q-SPECT/CT during hospitalization, and 3 months after discharge. At follow-up (FU), Q-SPECT/CT were analyzed and compared with pulmonary function tests (PFT), blood analysis (CRP, D-dimers, ferritin), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, and high-resolution CT scans (HRCT). Patients with one or more segmental perfusion defects outside the area of inflammation (PDOI) were treated with anticoagulation until FU. RESULTS: At baseline, PDOI were found in 50 of 105 patients (47.6 %). At FU, Q-SPECT/CT scans had improved significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and PDOI were recorded in 14 of 77 (18.2 %) patients. There was a significant correlation between mMRC score and the number of segmental perfusion defects (r\u00a0=\u00a00.511, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a weaker correlation with DLCO (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.333, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and KCO (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.373, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) at FU. Neither corticosteroid therapy nor HRCT results showed an influence on Q-SPECT/CT changes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.94, p\u00a0=\u00a00.74). CRP, D-Dimers and ferritin improved but did not show any association with the FU Q-SPECT/CT results (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08). CONCLUSION: Segmental mismatched perfusion defects are common in severe COVID-19 and are correlated with the degree of dyspnea. Longitudinal analyses of Q-SPECT/CT scans in severe COVID-19 may help understand possible mechanisms of long COVID and prolonged dyspnea.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) describes a syndrome of physical and cognitive decline that persists after acute symptoms of infection resolve. Few studies have explored PASC among nursing home (NH) residents. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at two NHs in Michigan. COVID-positive patients were identified from March 21, 2020 to October 26, 2021. The comparison group were patients who lived at the same NH but who were never infected during the study period. Minimum Data Set was used to examine trajectories of functional dependence (Activity of Daily Living [ADL] composite score) and cognitive function (Brief Interview for Mental Status [BIMS]). Linear mixed-effects models were constructed to estimate short-term change in function and cognition immediately following diagnosis and over time for an additional 12\u2009months, compared to pre-COVID and non-COVID trajectories and adjusting for sex, age, and dementia status. RESULTS: We identified 171 residents (90 COVID-19 positive, 81 non-COVID) with 719 observations for our analyses. Cohort characteristics included: 108 (63%)\u2009\u2265\u200980\u2009yrs.; 121 (71%) female; 160 (94%) non-Hispanic white; median of 3 comorbidities (IQR 2-4), with no significant differences in characteristics between groups. COVID-19 infection affected the trajectory of ADL recovery for the first 9\u2009months following infection, characterized by an immediate post-infection decrease in functional status post-infection (-0.60 points, p\u2009=\u20090.002) followed by improvement toward the expected functional trajectory sans infection (0.04 points per month following infection, p\u2009=\u20090.271). CONCLUSIONS: NH residents experienced a significant functional decline that persisted for 9\u2009months following acute infection. Further research is needed to determine whether increased rehabilitation services after COVID-19 may help mitigate this decline.",

        "abstract": "The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory distress, multiorgan dysfunction and, in some cases, death. The virus is also responsible for post-COVID-19 condition (commonly referred to as 'long COVID'). SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of approximately 30\u2009kb, which encodes 26 proteins. It has been reported to affect multiple pathways in infected cells, resulting, in many cases, in the induction of a 'cytokine storm' and cellular senescence. Perhaps because it is an RNA virus, replicating largely in the cytoplasm, the effect of SARS-Cov-2 on genome stability and DNA damage responses (DDRs) has received relatively little attention. However, it is now becoming clear that the virus causes damage to cellular DNA, as shown by the presence of micronuclei, DNA repair foci and increased comet tails in infected cells. This review considers recent evidence indicating how SARS-CoV-2 causes genome instability, deregulates the cell cycle and targets specific components of DDR pathways. The significance of the virus's ability to cause cellular senescence is also considered, as are the implications of genome instability for patients suffering from long COVID.",

Long-COVID is characterized by symptoms commonly seen in autonomic disorders including fatigue, brain fog, light-headedness, and palpitations. This article will critically evaluate recent findings and studies on Long-COVID and its physiological autonomic manifestations. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have reported on the prevalence of different symptoms and autonomic disorders in Long-COVID cohorts. Autonomic nervous system function, including both the parasympathetic and sympathetic limbs, has been studied using different testing techniques in Long-COVID patients. While numerous mechanisms may contribute to Long-COVID autonomic pathophysiology, it is currently unclear which ones lead to a Long-COVID presentation. To date, studies have not tested treatment options for autonomic disorders in Long-COVID patients. Long-COVID is associated with autonomic abnormalities. There is a high prevalence of clinical autonomic disorders among Long-COVID patients, with limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms and the effectiveness of treatment options.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been growing clinical awareness in recent years of the long-term physical and psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, known as Long COVID. The prevalence of Long COVID is approximately 10% of those infected by the virus. Long COVID is associated with physical and neuropsychological symptoms, including those related to mental health, psychological wellbeing, and cognition. However, research on psychological interventions is still in its early stages, in which means that available results are still limited. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of a program based on amygdala and insula retraining (AIR) combined with mindfulness training (AIR\u2009+\u2009Mindfulness) on the improvement of quality of life, psychological well-being, and cognition in patients with Long COVID. METHODS: This study protocol presents a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) that encompasses baseline, post-treatment, and six-month follow-up assessment time points. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with Long COVID by the Spanish National Health Service will be randomly assigned to either AIR\u2009+\u2009Mindfulness (n\u2009=\u200950) or relaxation intervention (n\u2009=\u200950), the latter as a control group. The primary outcome will be quality of life assessed using the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). Additional outcomes such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, memory, and sleep quality will also be evaluated. Mixed effects regression models will be used to estimate the effectiveness of the program, and effect size calculations will be made. DISCUSSION: Long COVID syndrome is a clinical condition characterized by the persistence of symptoms for at least 12 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 that significantly affects people's quality of life. This will be the first RCT conducted in Spain to apply a psychotherapy program for the management of symptoms derived from Long COVID. Positive results from this RCT may have a significant impact on the clinical context by confirming the beneficial effect of the intervention program being evaluated on improving the symptoms of Long COVID syndrome and aiding the development of better action strategies for these patients.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Long COVID has afflicted tens of millions globally leaving many previously-healthy persons severely and indefinitely debilitated. The objective here was to report cases of complete, rapid remission of severe forms of long COVID following certain monoclonal antibody (MCA) infusions and review the corresponding pathophysiological implications. DESIGN: Case histories of the first three index events (among others) are presented. Unaware of others with similar remissions, each subject independently completed personal narratives and standardized surveys regarding demographics/occupation, past history, and the presence and respective severity grading of 33 signs/symptoms associated with long COVID, comparing the presence/severity of those symptoms during the pre-COVID, long-COVID, post-vaccination, and post-MCA phases. SETTING: Patient interviews, e-mails and telephone conversations. SUBJECTS: Three previously healthy, middle-aged, highly-functioning persons, two women and one man (ages 60, 43, and 63\u00a0years respectively) who, post-acute COVID-19 infection, developed chronic, unrelenting fatigue and cognitive impairment along with other severe, disabling symptoms. Each then independently reported incidental and unanticipated complete remissions within days of MCA treatment. INTERVENTIONS: The casirivimab/imdevimab cocktail. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Irrespective of sex, age, medical history, vaccination status, or illness duration (18, 8 and 5\u00a0months, respectively), each subject experienced the same complete remission of their persistent disabling disease within a week of MCA infusion. Each rapidly returned to normal health and previous lifestyles/occupations with normalized exercise tolerance, still sustained to date over two years later. CONCLUSIONS: These index cases provide compelling clinical signals that MCA infusions may be capable of treating long COVID in certain cases, including those with severe debilitation. While the complete and sustained remissions observed here may only apply to long COVID resulting from pre-Delta variants and the specific MCA infused, the striking rapid and complete remissions observed in these cases also provide mechanistic implications for treating/managing other post-viral chronic conditions and long COVID from other variants.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a frequent and one of the most debilitating symptoms in post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Recently, we proposed that fatigue is caused by hypoactivity of the brain's arousal network and reflected by a reduction of cognitive processing speed. However, it is unclear whether cognitive slowing is revealed by standard neuropsychological tests, represents a selective deficit, and how it develops over time. OBJECTIVES: This prospective study assesses whether PCS patients show deficits particularly in tests relying on processing speed and provides the first longitudinal assessment focusing on processing speed in PCS patients. METHODS: Eighty-eight PCS patients with cognitive complaints and 50 matched healthy controls underwent neuropsychological assessment. Seventy-seven patients were subsequently assessed at 6-month follow-up. The Test for Attentional Performance measured tonic alertness as primary study outcome and additional attentional functions. The Neuropsychological Assessment Battery evaluated all key cognitive domains. RESULTS: Patients showed cognitive slowing indicated by longer reaction times compared to control participants (r\u2009=\u20090.51, p\u2009<\u20090.001) in a simple-response tonic alertness task and in all more complex tasks requiring speeded performance. Reduced alertness correlated with higher fatigue (r\u2009=\u2009\u2009-\u20090.408, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Alertness dysfunction remained unchanged at 6-month follow-up (p\u2009=\u20090.240) and the same was true for most attention tasks and cognitive domains. CONCLUSION: Hypoarousal is a core deficit in PCS which becomes evident as a selective decrease of processing speed observed in standard neuropsychological tests. This core deficit persists without any signs of amelioration over a 6-month period of time.",

Ample CREB phosphorylation is required for neurotrophin expression, which is of key importance for preventing and regenerating neurological disorders, including the sequelae of long COVID syndrome. Here we created lipid-peptide nanoassemblies with different liquid crystalline structural organizations (cubosomes, hexosomes, and vesicles) as innovative nanomedicine delivery systems of bioactive PUFA-plasmalogens (vinyl ether phospholipids with polyunsaturated fatty acid chains) and a neurotrophic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP). Considering that plasmalogen deficiency is a potentially causative factor for neurodegeneration, we examined the impact of nanoassemblies type and incubation time in an in vitro Parkinson's disease (PD) model as critical parameters for the induction of CREB phosphorylation. The determined kinetic changes in CREB, AKT, and ERK-protein phosphorylation reveal that non-lamellar PUFA-plasmalogen-loaded liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles significantly prolong CREB activation in the neurodegeneration model, an effect unattainable with free drugs, and this effect can be further enhanced by the cell-penetrating peptide PACAP.

This study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 patients with pre-pandemic insomnia have a greater risk of developing long COVID and whether long COVID is in turn associated with higher incident rates of insomnia symptoms after infection. METHODS: Data were collected cross-sectionally (May-Dec 2021) as part of an international collaborative study involving participants from 16 countries. A total of 2311 participants (18-99 years old) with COVID-19 provided valid responses to a web-based survey about sleep, insomnia, and health-related variables.

However, mechanisms of long COVID are not clearly understood, and underlying biomarkers that can affect the long-term consequences of COVID-19 are paramount to be identified. METHODS: Participants for the current study were from a cohort study of COVID-19 survivors discharged from hospital between Jan 7, and May 29, 2020. We profiled the proteomic of plasma samples from hospitalised COVID-19 survivors at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year after symptom onset and age and sex matched healthy controls. Fold-change of >2 or <0.5, and false-discovery rate adjusted P value of 0.05 were used to filter differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). In-genuity pathway analysis was performed to explore the down-stream effects in the dataset of significantly up- or down-regulated proteins. Proteins were integrated with long-term consequences of COVID-19 survivors to explore potential biomarkers of long COVID. FINDINGS: The proteomic of 709 plasma samples from 181 COVID-19 survivors and 181 matched healthy controls was profiled. In both COVID-19 and control group, 114 (63%) were male. The results indicated four major recovery modes of biological processes. Pathways related to cell-matrix interactions and cytoskeletal remodeling and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy pathways recovered relatively earlier which was before 1-year after infection. Majority of immune response pathways, complement and coagulation cascade, and cholesterol metabolism returned to similar status of matched healthy controls later but before 2-year after infection. Fc receptor signaling pathway still did not return to status similar to healthy controls at 2-year follow-up. Pathways related to neuron generation and differentiation showed persistent suppression across 2-year after infection. Among 98 DEPs from the above pathways, evidence was found for association of 11 proteins with lung function recovery, with the associations consistent at two consecutive or all three follow-ups. These proteins were mainly enriched in complement and coagulation (COMP, PLG, SERPINE1, SRGN, COL1A1, FLNA, and APOE) and hypertrophic/dilated cardiomyopathy (TPM2, TPM1, and AGT) pathways. Two DEPs (APOA4 and LRP1) involved in both neuron and cholesterol pathways showed associations with smell disorder.

The spectrum of symptoms is broad and heterogeneous with fatigue being the most often reported sequela. Easily accessible blood biomarkers to determine PASC severity are lacking. Thus, our study aimed to correlate immune phenotypes with PASC across the severity spectrum of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 176 originally immunona\u00efve, convalescent COVID-19 patients from a prospective cohort during the first pandemic phase were stratified by initial disease severity and underwent clinical, psychosocial, and immune phenotyping around 10\u00a0weeks after first COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19-associated fatigue dynamics were assessed and related to clinical and immune phenotypes. RESULTS: Fatigue and severe fatigue were commonly reported irrespective of initial COVID-19 severity or organ-specific PASC. A clinically relevant increase in fatigue severity after COVID-19 was detected in all groups. Neutralizing antibody titers were higher in patients with severe acute disease, but no association was found between antibody titers and PASC. While absolute peripheral blood immune cell counts in originally immunona\u00efve PASC patients did not differ from unexposed controls, peripheral CD3+CD4+ T cell counts were independently correlated with fatigue severity across all strata in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were at similar risk of self-reported PASC irrespective of initial disease severity.

        "abstract": "Long COVID symptoms typically occur within 3 months of an initial COVID-19 infection, last for more than 2 months, and cannot be explained by other diagnoses. The most common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, coughing, and cognitive impairment. The mechanisms of long COVID are not fully understood, but several hypotheses have been put forth. These include coagulation and fibrosis pathway activation, inflammatory and autoimmune manifestations, persistent virus presence, and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a therapeutic method in which a person inhales 100% oxygen under pressure greater than that of the atmosphere. HBOT has some therapeutic effects, including improvement of microcirculation, inhibition of cytokine release leading to a reduction in inflammatory responses, inhibition of autoimmune responses, and promotion of neurological repair. Several clinical trials have been carried out using HBOT to treat long COVID. The results suggest that HBOT helps to improve symptom severity, reduce symptom duration, and enhance patients' quality of life. It is believed that HBOT is an effective option for patients with long COVID, which is worth actively promoting.",

In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of PASC in SOTR, its descriptive characteristics, and associated risk factors. METHODS: We retrospectively identified SOTRs with acute COVID-19 between June 1, 2020 and April 15, 2022, and abstracted demographic and medical history, characteristics of acute COVID-19 illness, and COVID-19 vaccination status. We defined PASC as ongoing/new symptoms present at 6\u00a0weeks or longer following acute COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 208 SOTRs with acute COVID-19, 72 (35%) developed PASC. Common symptoms were respiratory symptoms (67%), headache (40%), and difficulty concentrating (10%). Severe acute COVID-19 disease and presence of respiratory symptoms were associated with higher odds of PASC in multivariable analyses, while receipt of at least one COVID-19 vaccination prior to transplantation was protective. CONCLUSION: We found that PASC occurs in about a third of SOTRs with acute COVID-19 and has similar symptoms as described previously in immunocompetent hosts. Pre-transplant vaccination may be protective. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed.",

        "abstract": "A growing number of working individuals have developed long COVID (LC) after COVID-19 infection. Economic analyses indicate that workers' LC symptoms contribute to workforce shortages. However, factors that affect return-to-work from perspectives of people with LC remain largely underexplored. This qualitative study of people with LC conducted by researchers living with LC aimed to identify participants' return-to-work experiences using Total Worker Health\u00ae and Episodic Disability frameworks. 10% of participants who participated in a mixed-method global internet survey, had LC symptoms >3 months, and responded in English were randomly selected for thematic analysis using NVivo12. 15% of responses were independently double-coded to identify coding discrepancies. Participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0510) were predominately white and had at least a baccalaureate degree. Four primary work-related themes emerged: 1) strong desire and need to return to work motivated by sense of purpose and financial precarity; 2) diverse and episodic LC symptoms intersect with organization of work and home life; 3) pervasiveness of LC disbelief and stigma at work and in medical settings; and 4) support of medical providers is key to successful return-to-work. Participants described how fluctuation of symptoms, exacerbated by work-related tasks, made returning to work challenging. Participants' ability to work was often predicated on job accommodations and support. Non-work factors were also essential, especially being able to receive an LC medical diagnosis (key to accessing leave and accommodations) and help at home to manage non-work activities. Many participants described barriers accessing these supports, illuminating stigma and disbelief in LC as a medical condition. Qualitative findings indicate needs for workplace accommodations tailored to fluctuating symptoms, continuously re-evaluated by workers and supervisors together. Reductions in medical barriers to access work accommodations is also critical since many medical providers remain unaware of LC, and workers may lack a positive COVID test result.",

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances in patients post COVID-19. We systematically searched relevant studies from three databases, including Medline, Embase and Scopus. Original articles were included based on specific criteria: peer-reviewed, observational studies involving adults (18 or older) with confirmed post COVID-19 status through PCR testing and focused on sleep in the context of post COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included non-English articles, studies with insufficient data, and narrative/systematic reviews. The search was performed from 31st July 2023 to 15th August 2023. We identified 35 eligible papers; however, we excluded 6 studies which did not describe the sleep assessment. We used a random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances. RESULTS: 29 studies involved 13,935 long COVID-19 patients; approximately 39% of participants were male aged 18 to 97\u00a0years. The overall pooled prevalence of sleep disturbance was 46% (95% CI: 38-54%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the pooled prevalence of poor sleep quality was 56% (95% CI: 47-65%). The pooled prevalence of insomnia was 38% (95% CI: 28-48%). Finally, the pooled prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 14% (95% CI: 0-29%). CONCLUSION: Sleep disturbances are common in long COVID-19 patients. The healthcare sector should recognise these sleep issues and provide an early, effective treatment to prevent long-term sequelae of sleep problems.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome (PACS) is a growing concern, with headache being a particularly debilitating symptom with high prevalence. The long-term effects of COVID-19 and post-COVID headache on brain function remain poorly understood, particularly among non-hospitalized individuals. This study focused on the power-law scaling behavior of functional brain dynamics, indexed by the Hurst exponent (H). This measure is suppressed during physiological and psychological distress and was thus hypothesized to be reduced in individuals with post-COVID syndrome, with greatest reductions among those with persistent headache. METHODS: Resting-state blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected for 57 individuals who had COVID-19 (32 with no headache, 14 with ongoing headache, 11 recovered) and 17 controls who had cold and flu-like symptoms but \u00a0tested negative for COVID-19. Individuals were assessed an average of 4-5 months after COVID testing, in a cross-sectional, observational study design. RESULTS: No significant differences in H values were found between non-headache COVID-19 and control groups., while those with ongoing headache had significantly reduced H values, and those who had recovered from headache had elevated H values, relative to non-headache groups. Effects were greatest in temporal, sensorimotor, and insular brain regions. Reduced H in these regions was also associated with decreased BOLD activity and local functional connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie persistent post-COVID headache, with reduced BOLD scaling as a potential biomarker that is specific to this debilitating condition.",

RECENT FINDINGS: Headache is one of the commonest symptoms of COVID-19 during acute infection and it is often experienced by individuals who go on to develop long COVID. There is a higher prevalence of headache in individuals with long COVID who contracted the Delta variant than in those who were infected with the Wuhan or Alpha variants. Headaches related to COVID-19 infection are commoner and may be more intense in women.There are indications that presence of headache might indicate a more benign COVID-19 infection and a better chance of survival. However, the impact of COVID-19 related headache could be substantial leading to poor quality of life in individuals affected. Headache that changes in its nature in terms of frequency and severity should be investigated to exclude cerebrovascular complications. There are promising new therapies for its treatment, but further research is needed. SUMMARY: The findings of this review can promote a better understanding of COVID-19 related headache and guide clinicians in the management of patients.",

METHODS: The study employed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial approach to assess the efficacy of utilizing functional MRI of the brain as a neuroprotective therapy for treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome following COVID-19. The study included 30 patients matched by sex and age with post-COVID asthenic syndrome. All patients were examined with MFI-20, MoCA, FAS-10 scales, MRI using a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3\u00a0T scanner before and after a course of therapy with coordination complex with succinate acid anion (CCSA) or placebo (15 patients each) using resting state fMRI and with cognitive paradigm. RESULTS: The changes obtained as a result of the treatment of post-Covid asthenic syndrome demonstrated clinical superiority in the reduction of asthenic symptoms for the group of patients treated with CCSA (MFI-20 scores: -20\u00b70 points in the CCSA group compared to -12 points in the placebo group, p\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7043). The data obtained also correlate with the analysis of task fMRI and resting state fMRI may indicate an increase in the functional cognitive status after a course of therapy with CCSA. Clinically, this correlates with a statistically significant improvement in the MoCA score (2 points in the CCSA group compared to 1 point in the placebo group, p\u00a0<\u00a00\u00b705). CONCLUSIONS: the study demonstrates the potential effectiveness of CCSA therapy in relation to a wide range of symptoms (chronic fatigue syndrome/ asthenic syndrome and cognitive impairment) in patients with post-COVID syndrome.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long COVID has affected 13.5% of Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare System users during the first pandemic year. With 700,000+ United States Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19, addressing the impact of Long COVID on this population is crucial. Since empirically-based mental health interventions for Long COVID are lacking, a vital need exists for a tailored recovery-oriented intervention for this population. This study intends to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel recovery-oriented intervention, Long COVID Coping and Recovery (LCCR), for Veterans with Long COVID, aiming to support symptom management and quality of life. LCCR is an adaptation of Continuous Identity Cognitive Therapy (CI-CT), a suicide recovery-oriented treatment for Veterans. METHODS: In a two-year open-label pilot, three single-arm treatment trials will be conducted with 18 Veterans suffering from Long COVID. Each trial includes 16 weekly 60-min sessions delivered via VA Video Connect (VVC) and/or VA WebEx. Primary objectives include optimizing LCCR for Veterans with Long COVID and assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, using attendance and retention rates, drop-out statistics, and client satisfaction levels. Additionally, potential benefits of LCCR will be explored by evaluating alterations in quality of life, resilience, mental health status (anxiety, depression, suicide risk/behavior), and personal identity. The protocol has been tailored based on Veterans' needs assessment interviews and stakeholder feedback. CONCLUSION: If the LCCR intervention proves feasible and acceptable, a manualized version will be created and a randomized controlled trial planned to examine its efficacy in the broader Veteran population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive complaints are frequent following COVID-19 infection, but assessment of whether these complaints map onto objective cognitive findings may not be routine in busy clinical settings. Consequently, opportunities to confirm these complaints and to provide follow-up referrals and appropriate care may be missed, thereby impacting patients' functional independence and quality of life. African Americans are vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19, and thus represent a minority group in whom subjective concerns are especially important to investigate. Towards this end, we examined the frequency and correlates of subjective complaints and objective screening results of African American patients referred to the Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital, a large county teaching hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. METHODS: Eighty seven African American patients (mean age\u00a0=\u00a052.5, SD\u00a0=\u00a010.5, range\u00a0=\u00a030-73) were evaluated between January 28, 2021-October 14, 2021 in the Grady PASC clinic. They ranged from 1 to 17 months post positive SARS-COV-2 antigen testing. Patients were administered a subjective cognitive complaint questionnaire (PROMIS Cognitive Function Scale Short Form 8a) as well as cognitive screening measures including the Mini-Cog (3 item recall, clock) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (timed visuomotor sequencing). Mood was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and anxiety via the Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale. Published norms were used to identify clinically elevated scores. RESULTS: Sixty six (76%) patients denied experiencing meaningful cognitive concerns, and of these, 25 (38%) had positive cognitive screens indicating impaired performance on objective testing. Of 21 patients with subjectively elevated cognitive concerns, 17 (81%) also had positive cognitive screens. There were no significant differences in sociodemographic factors (p values\u00a0=\u00a0.07-.71), days post-acute positive SARS-COV-2 Antigen Test (p\u00a0=\u00a0.99), disease severity (p values\u00a0=\u00a0.67-.75), or COVID-19 comorbidity indices (medical conditions (p values\u00a0=\u00a0.20-.77), substance abuse (p\u00a0=\u00a0.79), psychiatric history (p values\u00a0=\u00a0.11-.99) in those with or without subjective complaints and objective cognitive findings. However, patients with subjective complaints and objective cognitive findings reported more post-COVID-19 anxiety (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and depression (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate a high concordance between subjective complaints on the PROMIS Cognitive Scale and objectively confirmed cognitive impairments in African Americans. Further, almost 40% who reported no cognitive complaints screened positive for cognitive impairment. Although depression and anxiety are associated with subjective complaints, they do not account for positive cognitive screening results, as those patients without depressive complaints also had similar rates of positive objective screens. The findings suggest that cognitive screening using assessment tools should be routinely performed in African Americans, especially those reporting cognitive symptoms on outcome scales. While future studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes, we highly recommend follow-ups in those with positive screens to characterize the specific domains that are impacted and that could affect activities of daily living and quality of life.",

Many of these natural products have also been used to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections or symptoms of the post- and long-COVID form, owing to the scarcity of clinically approved therapeutics. AIM OF THE STUDY: The ongoing threat posed by SARS-CoV-2, along with the rapidly evolving new variants, requires the development of new antiviral compounds. The aim of this study was to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 herbal and fungal extracts used in traditional medicine against acute respiratory infection, inflammation, and related symptoms. Additionally, we sought to characterize their bioactive constituents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antiviral activity and cell cytotoxicity of 179 herbal and fungal extracts were evaluated using two SARS-CoV-2 infection assays in Caco-2\u00a0cells. 19 plant extracts with and without anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity underwent detailed dereplication using molecular networking. RESULTS: Extracts from Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels roots, Annona squamosa L. seeds, Azadirachta indica A. Juss. fruits, Buddleja officinalis Maxim. flowers, Burkea africana Hook. bark and Clinopodium menthifolium (Host) Stace aerial parts showed a potent anti SARS-CoV-2 activity (IC50\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) with only moderate cytotoxicity (CC50\u00a0>\u00a060\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Caco-2). By performing the dereplication with a bioactivity-featured molecular network (MN) on the extract library level, rather than on the level of individual extracts, we could pinpoint compounds characteristic for active extracts. Thus, a straight-forward identification of potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 natural compounds was achieved prior to any fractionation or isolation efforts. CONCLUSIONS: A sophisticated hyphenation of empirical knowledge with MS-based bioinformatics and automated compound annotation was applied to decipher the chemical space of the investigated extracts. The correlation with experimentally assessed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities helped in predicting compound classes and structural elements relevant for the antiviral activities. Consequently, this accelerated the identification of constituents from the investigated mixtures with inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2.",

However, some people still become infected with SARS-CoV-2 following a third (booster) vaccination. This study describes the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 illness following a third vaccination and assesses the risk of progression to symptomatic disease in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals with time since vaccination. METHODS: This prospective, community-based, case-control study used data from UK-based, adult (\u226518 years) users of the COVID Symptom Study mobile application, self-reporting a first positive COVID-19 test between June 1, 2021 and April 1, 2022. To describe the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 illness following a third vaccination, we selected cases and controls who had received a third and second dose of monovalent vaccination against COVID-19, respectively, and reported a first positive SARS-CoV-2 test at least 7 days after most recent vaccination. Cases and controls were matched (1:1) based on age, sex, BMI, time between first vaccination and infection, and week of testing. We used logistic regression models (adjusted for age, sex, BMI, level of social deprivation and frailty) to analyse associations of disease severity, overall disease duration, and individual symptoms with booster vaccination status. To assess for potential waning of vaccine effectiveness, we compared disease severity, duration, and symptom profiles of individuals testing positive within 3 months of most recent vaccination (reference group) to profiles of individuals infected between 3 and 4, 4-5, and 5-6 months, for both third and second dose. All analyses were stratified by time period, based on the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant at time of infection (Delta: June 1, 2021-27 Nov, 2021; Omicron: 20 Dec, 2021-Apr 1, 2022). FINDINGS: During the study period, 50,162 (Delta period) and 162,041 (Omicron) participants reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. During the Delta period, infection following three vaccination doses was associated with lower odds of long COVID (symptoms\u2265 4 weeks) (OR=0.83, CI[0.50-1.36], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), hospitalisation (OR=0.55, CI[0.39-0.75], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and severe symptoms (OR=0.36, CI[0.27-0.49], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and higher odds of asymptomatic infection (OR=3.45, CI[2.86-4.16], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), compared to infection following only two vaccination doses. During the Omicron period, infection following three vaccination doses was associated with lower odds of severe symptoms (OR=0.48, CI[0.42-0.55], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). During the Delta period, infected individuals were less likely to report almost all individual symptoms after a third vaccination. During the Omicron period, individuals were less likely to report most symptoms after a third vaccination, except for upper respiratory symptoms e.g. sneezing (OR=1.40, CI[1.18-1.35], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), runny nose (OR=1.26, CI[1.18-1.35], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), sore throat (OR=1.17, CI[1.10-1.25], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and hoarse voice (OR=1.13, CI[1.06-1.21], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), which were more likely to be reported. There was evidence of reduced vaccine effectiveness during both Delta and Omicron periods in those infected more than 3 months after their most recent vaccination, with increased reporting of severe symptoms, long duration illness, and most individual symptoms. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that a third dose of monovalent vaccine may reduce symptoms, severity and duration of SARS-CoV-2 infection following vaccination. For Omicron variants, the third vaccination appears to reduce overall symptom burden but may increase upper respiratory symptoms, potentially due to immunological priming. There is evidence of waning vaccine effectiveness against progression to symptomatic and severe disease and long COVID after three months. Our findings support ongoing booster vaccination promotion amongst individuals at high risk from COVID-19, to reduce severe symptoms and duration of illness, and health system burden. Disseminating knowledge on expected symptoms following booster vaccination may encourage vaccine uptake.",

METHODS: A Post-Acute COVID Clinic for persons <21 years of age was established in October 2020. Intake was standardized and management was tailored to presenting symptoms. Data were abstracted from the charts of all patients evaluated through December 2021, and the study cohort consisted of patients who had a history of confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, had \u22651 symptom persisting for \u226512 weeks and had no pre-existing diagnosis that explained the symptoms. A structured follow-up interview was conducted in early 2022. RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were referred, 81 of whom met inclusion criteria. The median age was 14 years (interquartile range, 13-16), and most were female, White/Caucasian and had commercial health insurance. Patients reported previously good health but over half reported moderate-to-severe disability at their first visit. Two clusters of presenting symptoms-fatigue with multiple symptoms, and fatigue and headache with cardiopulmonary symptoms-were identified. Extensive routine testing did not affirm alternative diagnoses. Incident conditions-most commonly anxiety, depression and/or panic disorder; migraines; and autonomic dysfunction-were diagnosed on clinical grounds. Telephone interviews (N = 55) revealed that 78% of patients were improved by about 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of a single-center, referral-based, observational cohort, this study provides reassurance to patients and parents in that most cases of long COVID were self-limited. Extensive evaluations may be more useful in ruling out alternative diagnoses than in affirming specific physiologic disturbances.",

It is also critical to understand persistence of neutralizing antibody (NAb) and of T-cell mediated immunity and the role of hybrid immunity in preventing SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. This prospective cohort study included Omicron COVID-19 individuals from April to June 2022 in Shanghai, China, during a large epidemic caused by the Omicron BA.2 variant. A total of 8945 patients from three medical centres were included in the follow up programme from November 2022 to February 2023. Of 6412 individuals enrolled for the long COVID analysis, 605 (9.4%) individuals experienced at least one sequelae, mainly had fatigue and mental symptoms specific to Omicron BA.2 infection compared with other common respiratory tract infections. During the second-visit, 548 (12.1%) cases of Omicron reinfection were identified. Hybrid immunity with full and booster vaccination had reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection by 0.29-fold (95% CI: 0.63-0.81) and 0.23-fold (95% CI: 0.68-0.87), respectively. For 469 participants willing to the hospital during the first visit, those who received full (72 [IQR, 36-156]) or booster (64 [IQR, 28-132]) vaccination had significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than those with incomplete vaccination (36 [IQR, 16-79]).

        "abstract": "The human mouth, or oral cavity, is at the crossroads of our external and internal environments, and it is increasingly evident that local colonization of dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) tissues and cells by bacteria and viruses may also have systemic effects across myriad diseases and disorders. Better understanding of this phenomenon will require a holistic understanding of host-microbial interactions in both spatiotemporal and biogeographical contexts while also considering person-, organ-, tissue-, cell-, and molecular-level variation. After the acute phase interaction with microbes, the establishment of site-specific reservoirs constitutes an important relationship to understand within the human body; however, despite a preliminary understanding of how viral reservoirs originate and persist across the human body, the landscape of single-cell and spatial multiomic tools has challenged our current understanding of what cells and niches can support microbial reservoirs. The lack of complete understanding impacts research into these relevant topics and implementing precision care for microbial-induced or microbial-influenced diseases. Here, via the lens of acute and chronic microbial infections of the DOC tissues, the goal of this review is to highlight and link the emerging spatiotemporal biogeography of host-viral interactomics at 3 levels: (1) DOC cell types in distinct tissues, (2) DOC-associated microbes, and (3) niche-specific DOC pathologies. Further, we will focus on the impact of postacute infectious syndromes such as long COVID, neurodegenerative disorders, and other underappreciated postviral conditions. We will provide hypotheses about how DOC tissues may play roles systemically in these conditions. Throughout, we will underscore how COVID-19 has catalyzed a new understanding of these biological questions, discuss future directions to study these phenomena, and highlight the utility of noninvasive oral biofluids in screening, monitoring, and intervening to prevent and/or ameliorate human infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Early prevention and management of psychiatric symptoms in long COVID (or post-COVID-19 conditions) are crucial for reducing long-term disability. Existing clinical guidelines recommend the use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a promising therapeutic approach for various common psychiatric disorders due to their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective characteristics. This study aims to investigate the potential efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs in alleviating the psychiatric sequelae following COVID-19. METHODS: This 1-year retrospective cohort study used the TriNetX electronic health records network to examine the effects of omega-3 PUFAs supplements on psychiatric sequelae in adults diagnosed with COVID-19. Using propensity-score matching, the study compared those who used omega-3 PUFAs supplements with those who did not, assessing outcomes including depression, anxiety disorders, insomnia, and other somatic conditions up to a year after COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: In 16,962 patients who received omega-3 PUFAs supplements and 2,248,803 who did not, omega-3 supplementation significantly reduced the risk of developing psychiatric sequelae post-COVID-19 diagnosis (HR, 0.804; 95% CI, 0.729 to 0.888). Specifically, the risks for depression (HR, 0.828; 95% CI, 0.714 to 0.960), anxiety disorders (HR, 0.833; 95% CI, 0.743 to 0.933), and insomnia (HR, 0.679; 95% CI, 0.531 to 0.869) were reduced in the omega-3 group. This effect was consistent across sex, race, 18-59 age group, and patients with less than two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The omega-3 group also had a lower risk of cough and myalgia, but no significant difference was noted for other symptoms like chest pain, abnormal breathing, abdominal issues, fatigue, headache, and cognitive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 PUFAs may require re-evaluation as a preventive strategy against adverse mental health outcomes post-COVID-19 in placebo-controlled clinical trials.",

This study examines the possible\u00a0effects of COVID-19 vaccination on the persistence of post-recovery symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia to evaluate 14 prevalent long COVID-19 symptoms among vaccinated individuals. Patients self-reported their acute COVID-19 experience, demographic information, chronic conditions, vaccine history, and persistent symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 484 patients, four respondents were excluded from the study as they had not received the vaccine, and 111 (23.1%) were vaccinated but did not get infected and were also excluded. The remaining 369 (76.9%) reported COVID-19 and a vaccination and thus they were included in the study. The occurrence of post-COVID-19 symptoms was reported\u00a0in 59 (16.1%) for\u2009\u2264\u20093\u00a0months, 202 (54.8%) experienced persistent symptoms 3-6\u00a0months, and 108 (29.1%) reported symptoms lasting\u2009>\u20096\u00a0months. In relation to age group, persistent symptoms 3-6\u00a0months after recovery was more common in those\u2009>\u200950\u00a0years and symptoms lasting\u2009>\u20096\u00a0months were more common in 30-50\u00a0years of age (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Of the included patients, 323 (87.5%) rated their health as good, 41 (11.1%) considered it fair, and 5 (1.4%) described their well-being as poor or terrible. CONCLUSION: The study provides information\u00a0of persistent symptoms in vaccinated individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 and highlights the need for targeted interventions to alleviate post-COVID-19 symptoms.

Sporadic outbreaks of PPMV-1 infection have occurred in pigeons in China; however, few cases of human PPMV-1 infection have been reported. The purpose of this article is to report a case of severe human PPMV-1 infection in an individual with probable post-COVID-19 syndrome (long COVID) who presented with rapidly progressing pulmonary infection. The patient was a 66-year-old man who was admitted to the intensive care unit 11 days after onset of pneumonia and recovered 64 days after onset. PPMV-1 was isolated from the patient's sputum and in cloacal smear samples from domesticated pigeons belonging to the patient's neighbour. Residual severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in respiratory and anal swab samples from the patient. Sequencing analyses revealed that the PPMV-1 genome belonged to genotype VI.2.1.1.2.2 and had the 112RRQKRF117 motif in the cleavage site of the fusion protein, which is indicative of high virulence.

Therefore, precise patient classification and exploration of the corresponding factors affecting long-COVID are crucial for tailored treatment strategies. Frailty is a common age-related clinical syndrome characterized by deteriorated physiological functions of multiple organ systems, which increases susceptibility to stressors. Herein, we performed an inclusion and exclusion analysis (definite COVID-19 infection diagnosis, clear underlying disease information, \u226560 years old, and repeated sampling of clinical cases) of 10,613 blood samples and identified frailty cases for further investigation. RNA-Seq data were used for differential gene expression and functional and pathway analyses. The results revealed that patients with frailty were more prone to poor health conversions and more sequelae, and the blood transcriptome had obvious disturbances in pathways associated with immune regulation, metabolism, and stress response. These adverse health transitions were significantly associated with mast cell activation. Additionally, NCAPG, MCM10, and CDC25C were identified as hub genes in the peripheral blood differential gene cluster, which could be used as diagnostic markers of poor health conversion.

However, few studies have investigated, so far, its effects on humoral-response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, reporting conflicting results. We aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline 25(OH)vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels on humoral-response to a two-dose cycle of Pfizer-BioNTech-vaccine up to 9-10 months after immunization. METHODS: We retrospectively included 119 consecutive healthcare-workers (median age 53 years) without a previous history of acute COVID-19 or anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins presence immunized with two doses of Comirnaty-vaccine from January to February 2021. 25(OH)D was measured at time of first-immunization. Immune response was evaluated at: time 0 (T0), before the first-dose; T1, time of second-dose (21 days after T0); T2, T3, T4 at 1, 5 and 9 months after T1, respectively. RESULTS: Median 25(OH)D levels were 25.6\u2009ng/mL, and vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D <20 ng/mL) was observed in 29 subjects (24.8%). In those with vitamin D deficiency, we found a non-significant trend towards lower antibody-titers at T3, and significantly lower titers at T4 as compared to those not vitamin D-deficient, also observing a more pronounced antibody-titers negative drop from peak-T2 and T4 in those with vitamin D deficiency. A positive correlation between 25(OH)D levels and antibody-titers at T4 (p\u2009=\u20090.043) was found. In multiple linear-regression analysis, 25(OH)D deficiency and older-age resulted as negative independent factors associated with antibody titer at T4 (p\u2009=\u20090.026, p\u2009=\u20090.004; respectively). CONCLUSION: In our relatively young cohort presenting low prevalence of hypovitaminosis D, the long-term humoral response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was negatively influenced by low baseline 25(OH)D.

The aim of this study was to determine whether detection of zinc concentration or vitamin D concentration could provide treatment benefits for patients with COVID-19, thus reducing the risk of them experiencing long COVID. METHODS: The interval between the date of COVID-19 diagnosis and the date of visit to pulmonary department for prolonged symptoms of COVID-19 was recorded for statistical analysis. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for detecting zinc and chemiluminescence immunoassay for detecting vitamin D were performed in laboratory tests. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included. Of the participants, 29.1\u00a0% and 27.3\u00a0% had vitamin D and zinc deficiency, respectively.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many COVID-19 patients report persistent symptoms, including cognitive disturbances. We performed a scoping review on this topic, focusing primarily on cognitive manifestations. METHODS: Abstracts and full texts of studies published on PubMed (until May 2023) addressing cognitive involvement persisting after SARS-CoV-2 infection were reviewed, focusing on terms used to name the cognitive syndrome, reported symptoms, their onset time and duration, and testing batteries employed. Reported psychiatric symptoms, their assessment tools, and more general manifestations were also extracted. RESULTS: Among the 947 records identified, 180 studies were included. Only one third of them used a label to define the syndrome. A minority of studies included patients according to stringent temporal criteria of syndrome onset (34%), whereas more studies reported a minimum required symptom duration (77%). The most frequently reported cognitive symptoms were memory and attentional-executive disturbances, and among psychiatric complaints, the most frequent were anxiety symptoms, depression, and sleep disturbances. Most studies reported fatigue among general symptoms. Thirty-six studies employed cognitive measures: screening tests alone (n\u2009=\u200919), full neuropsychological batteries (n\u2009=\u200925), or both (n\u2009=\u200929); 30 studies performed psychiatric testing. Cognitive deficits were demonstrated in 39% of subjects, the most frequently affected domains being attention/executive functions (90%) and memory (67%). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, no agreement exists on a label for post-COVID-19 cognitive syndrome. The time of symptom onset after acute infection and symptom duration are still discussed. Memory and attention-executive complaints and deficits, together with fatigue, anxiety, and depression symptoms, are consistently reported, but the objective evaluation of these symptoms is not standardized.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Owing to the nearly three-year-long COVID-19 pandemic, small personal transportation devices that allow for greater freedom of movement within the cities have gained attention. Therefore, the number of people using kick or electric scooters has increased. This study aimed to compare the characteristics of kick and electric scooter-related dental and maxillofacial trauma and provide helpful information for preventing scooter accidents, appropriate treatment of patients with scooter-related trauma, and policy establishment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study analysed the medical records of 310 patients who visited the emergency room of Ajou University Dental Hospital for kick and electric scooter-related oral and maxillofacial injuries between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022. Sex, age, scooter type, time, and mechanism of the accident, helmet use, alcohol consumption, dental and maxillofacial injury types, and treatment were analysed. RESULTS: The average age in the kick-scooter group (5.71\u2009\u00b1\u20094.25) was lower than that in the electric-scooter group (28.24\u2009\u00b1\u200910.02) (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). There were more males in both groups. The helmet usage rates of the two groups were 2.80% and 7.88%, respectively. In the kick-scooter group, periodontal damage was more common than pulp injury, while in the electric-scooter group, pulp injury was more common than periodontal injury. There was no significant difference in soft-tissue damage between the two groups; however, bone fractures occurred significantly more frequently in the electric-scooter group (p\u2009<\u2009.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Electric scooters cause more crown and bone fractures than kick scooters and require more active treatment of dental and maxillofacial injuries. Riders should use protective equipment to prevent dental and maxillofacial injury. Although there are regulations related to scooters, the effectiveness of both kick- and electric-scooter related laws needs to be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), gains cellular entry via interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of host cells. Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets the respiratory system, the neuromuscular system also appears to be affected in a large percentage of patients with acute or chronic COVID-19. The cause of the well-described neuromuscular manifestations resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unresolved. These may result from the neuromuscular-invasive capacity of the virus leading to direct injury. Alternatively, they may be the consequence of ACE2 inactivation either due to viral infection, ACE2 autoantibodies or both. Here, we made use of the Drosophila model to investigate whether ACE2 downregulation is sufficient to induce neuromuscular phenotypes. We show that moderate gene silencing of ACE2 orthologues Ance or Ance3 diminished survival on exposure to thermal stress only upon induction of neuromuscular fatigue driven by increased physical activity. A strong knockdown of Ance or Ance3 directed to muscle reduced or abolished adult viability and caused obvious motoric deficits including reduced locomotion and impaired flight capacity. Selective knockdown of Ance and Ance3 in neurons caused wing defects and an age-dependent decline in motor behaviour, respectively, in adult flies. Interestingly, RNA sequencing allowed us to discover several differentially spliced genes that are required for synaptic function downstream of Ance or Ance3 depletion. Our findings are therefore supportive of the notion that loss of a RAS-independent function for ACE2 contributes to the neuromuscular manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional survey study to define and characterize risk factors for severe COVID-19 in adults (\u226518\u2009years) treated at our virtual COVID-19 clinic from March 1, 2020, through March 31, 2021. We assessed patient demographics, symptom types, and persistence, incidence of PASC, and COVID-19-caused hospitalizations. Surveyed patients were also asked to rate their perception of the severity of their acute COVID-19 symptoms. Continuous variables were summarized descriptively. Differences among groups categorized by acute COVID-19 symptom severity level (mild/very mild, moderate, and severe/very severe) were evaluated with the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test for continuous measures and the Pearson \u03c72 test for categorical measures. A total of 3094 adults completed the survey. More respondents with severe/very severe acute COVID-19 symptoms reported having PASC than did those with mild/very mild and moderate acute symptoms. A significantly greater proportion of respondents with PASC were women (68.4% vs 56.7%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), had been hospitalized (12.2% vs 4.4%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), reported having negative psychological COVID-19-related repercussions (39.9% vs 15.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001), and required more than 1\u2009month to resume normal activities (38.8% vs 12.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001) than did those without PASC.

Insomnia is particularly prevalent in long-COVID. In the present study, we aimed at confirming and characterising insomnia in long-COVID patients through polysomnography and to identify whether its parameters differ from patients with chronic insomnia and no long-COVID history. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study, including 17 long-COVID patients with insomnia symptoms (cases), and 34 2:1 matched controls with a diagnostic of chronic insomnia and no history of long-COVID. All underwent a one-night polysomnography (PSG). RESULTS: First, we observed that long-COVID patients with insomnia complaints have altered PSG parameters, in favour of the diagnosis of chronic insomnia. Second, we show that insomnia related to long-COVID PSG parameters was not significantly different from regular chronic insomnia PSG parameters. DISCUSSION: Our results indicate that even though it is one of the most prevalent symptoms of long-COVID, its related insomnia resembles typical chronic insomnia, based on PSG studies. Even though additional studies are warranted, our results suggest that the pathophysiology and therapeutic options should be similar to those recommended for chronic insomnia.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge now with the long-COVID arising. Mitigation measures focused on case counting, assessment and determination of variants and their likely targets of infection and transmission, the pursuit of drug treatments, use and enhancement of masks, social distancing, vaccination, post-infection rehabilitation, and mass screening. The latter is of utmost importance given the current scenario of infections, reinfections, and long-term health effects. Research on screening platforms has been developed to provide more sensitive, specific, and reliable tests that are accessible to the entire population and can be used to assess the prognosis of the disease as well as the subsequent health follow-up of patients with sequelae of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the simulation of exhaled breath of COVID-19 patients by evaluation of three identified COVID-19 indicator breath biomarkers (acetone (ACE), acetaldehyde (ACH) and nitric oxide (NO)) by gas-phase infrared spectroscopy as a proof-of-concept principle for the detection of infected patients' exhaled breath fingerprint and subsequent follow-up. The specific fingerprints of each of the compounds and the overall fingerprint were obtained. The synthetic exhaled breath evaluation concept revealed a linearity of r\u00a0=\u00a00.99 for all compounds, and LODs of 6.42, 13.81, 9.22\u00a0ppm, and LOQs of 42.26, 52.57, 69.23\u00a0ppm for NO, ACE, and ACH, respectively. This study proves the fundamental feasibility of gas-phase infrared spectroscopy for fingerprinting lung damage biomarkers in exhaled breath of patients with COVID-19. This analysis would allow faster and cheaper screening and follow-up of infected individuals, which could improve mass screening in POC settings.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess COVID-19 fear and investigate factors associated with higher fear among COVID-19 survivors over 6 months after infection. METHODS: Cross-sectional study using multistage sampling (family practices within the highest 5th percentile of numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and random sample of patients within these practices) performed from March 15 to 17 July 2021. Adult patients with a laboratory-confirmed history of COVID-19 were recruited for a self-administered 79-item questionnaire including demographics, self-rated health, physical activity, COVID-19 characteristics, severity and the fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Comorbidity data were extracted from Estonian Health Insurance Fund. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with COVID-19 fear.

METHODS: Between May 2021 and January 2022, 397 patients with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective cohort study. All demographic, clinical and laboratory data and chest CT images of patients were retrospectively reviewed. RM-S, V-CAC-S, HS-S, PS-S and C-CT-SS scores were calculated, and their performance in predicting mortality and ICU requirement were evaluated by univariate and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 32 (8.1%) patients died, and 77 (19.4%) patients required ICU admission. Mortality and ICU admission were both associated with older age (p < 0.001). Sex distribution was similar in the deceased vs. survivor and ICU vs. non-ICU comparisons (p = 0.974 and p = 0.626, respectively). Multiple logistic regression revealed that mortality was independently associated with having a C-CT-SS score of \u2265 14 (p < 0.001) and severe RM-S category (p = 0.010), while ICU requirement was independently associated with having a C-CT-SS score of \u2265 14 (p < 0.001) and severe V-CAC-S category (p = 0.010).

METHODS: A prospective cohort study in three Belgian professional male football teams was performed during the 2020\u2009-\u20092021 season. Participants were submitted to strength, jump, and sprint tests and an aerobic performance test (the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery test (YYIR)). These tests were repeated at fixed time intervals throughout the season. Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before each official game. RESULTS: Of the 84 included participants, 22 were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during follow-up. At the first testing after infection (52.0\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u2009days after positive PCR testing) significantly higher percentages of maximal heart rate (%HRmax) were seen - within the isolated group of infected players- during (p\u2009=\u2009.006) and after the YYIR (2\u2009min after, p\u2009=\u2009.013), compared to pre-infection data.

The term long COVID has been used to refer to a range of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Little is known about the impact of such therapies on long COVID. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study, including all outpatients evaluated from April 2021 to March 2022 in Brescia, Lombardy, northern Italy. Patients were stratified in three groups: (a) treated with mAbs, (b) treated with antivirals drugs and (c) controls (patients eligible for a or b who refused treatment). Data were collected at baseline and at month 1 and 3 (data on self-reported symptoms were collected using a telephone-administered questionnaire). We assessed early COVID-19 therapies effectiveness in preventing hospitalization, death at 1 or 3\u00a0months and persisting symptoms at 3\u00a0months after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 649 patients were included in the study, of which 242 (37.3%) were treated with mAbs, 197 (30.3%) with antiviral drugs and 210 (32.4%) were not treated. Patients most frequently reported cerebro-cardiovascular diseases (36.7%) followed by obesity (22%). Overall, 29 patients (4.5%) died or were hospitalized at 1 or 3-month follow-up. Death or hospitalization was positively associated with older ages, with a significant linear trend (OR 3.05; 95% CI 1.16-8.06, for patients aged 80 or more years compared to those aged less than 65).

        "abstract": "The crosstalk between viral infections, amyloid formation and neurodegeneration has been discussed with varying intensity since the last century. Several viral proteins are known to be amyloidogenic. Post-acute sequalae (PAS) of viral infections is known for several viruses. SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 implicate connections between amyloid formation and severe outcomes in the acute infection, PAS and neurodegenerative diseases. Is the amyloid connection causation or just correlation? In this review we highlight several aspects where amyloids and viruses meet. The evolutionary driving forces that dictate protein amyloid formation propensity are different for viruses compared to prokaryotes and eukaryotes, while posttranslational endoproteolysis appears to be a common mechanism leading up to amyloid formation for both viral and human proteins. Not only do human and viral proteins form amyloid irrespective of each other but there are also several examples of co-operativity between amyloids, viruses and the inter-, and intra-host spread of the respective entity. Abnormal blood clotting in severe and long COVID and as a side effect in some vaccine recipients has been connected to amyloid formation of both the human fibrin and the viral Spike-protein. We conclude that there are many intersects between viruses and amyloids and, consequently, amyloid and virus research need to join forces here. We emphasize the need to accelerate development and implementation in clinical practice of antiviral drugs to preclude PAS and downstream neurological damage.

        "abstract": "AIM: To synthesise qualitative research on pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 and identify patient needs and experiences to develop nursing care strategies. BACKGROUND: Qualitative research on long COVID by subtype has not yet occurred. As pulmonary sequelae constitute a serious long COVID subtype, exploring patient experience and needs can generate knowledge to guide nursing practice. DESIGN: Systematised review methodology utilised on a purposive sample of published articles and reported using the PRISMA guidelines and checklists. Searched MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Google Scholar, for English or French articles published from February 2020 to June 2022; qualitative research with adults recovering from COVID-19 with evidence of pulmonary sequelae. METHODS: Established principles for data extraction followed related to data reduction, data presentation, data comparison, and conclusion formulation and verification. Analysis was informed by Thorne's Interpretive Description and extended with Meleis' transitions theory, Mishel's uncertainty in illness theory and Moore et al.'s holistic theory of unpleasant symptoms. The quality of included studies was assessed Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for qualitative research. RESULTS: Four articles with six pooled participants provided data to yield three main themes: (1) a novel health-illness transition, (2) lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis as antecedent to illness uncertainty, (3) and pulmonary symptoms that are compounded by fatigue and weakness. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 confers a unique health-illness transition, uncertainties and symptoms that can be addressed by theory informed nursing practice. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Advocacy, optimising the nurse-patient relationship, offering up-to-date information and addressing uncertainty may help patients cope with pulmonary sequelae, a complex subtype of long COVID with important considerations for clinical nursing care. Despite a lack of evidence-informed clinical pathways, nurses can support patients to understand novel treatments, support discharge planning and acknowledge the synergistic nature of pulmonary symptoms and fatigue to support health-illness transitions.

        "abstract": "Given the high prevalence of sleep disorders (e.g. insomnia) among long-COVID-19 patients (LC19Ps), approaches to tackle these disorders should not only depend on sleep specialists, but they should also involve general practitioners (GPs). Indeed, according to the World Health Organization, GPs should be on the front line in the management of LC19Ps. However, in real practice, little data with regard to the management of LC19Ps are available for GPs, which represents an embarrassing situation. Thus, the main aim of this correspondence was to provide GPs with some advice related to the management of sleep disorders in LC19Ps. The pieces advice presented in this correspondence are related to: i) Early and accurate recognition of sleep disorders, ii) General recommendations to manage sleep disorders in LC19Ps (e.g. encouraging vaccination against the virus); and iii) Specific recommendations, such as improving sleep hygiene (patients' behavior and diet), psychological or behavioral therapies (stimulus control therapy, relaxation, sleep restriction), promising tools (heart coherence, neurofeedback), and pharmacological treatment. The authors of this correspondence deeply believe that given the undesirable side effects associated with the use of hypnotics, the pharmacological approach must only be a \"last resort\". The authors believe that an important percentage of pharmacological prescriptions could be avoided if more focus is put on educating GPs to provide LC19Ps with more tools to deal with sleep disorders. The pieces advice presented in this correspondence are indispensable to resume the normal life of LC19Ps and to promote their mental health recovery.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies on long-term follow-up of patients with COVID-19 focused on hospitalised patients. No prospective study with structured follow-up has been performed in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To assess long-COVID and post-COVID (WHO definition: symptomatic at least 12\u2009weeks), describe lingering symptoms, their impact on daily activities, and general practice visits and explore risk factors for symptom duration in outpatients. METHODS: A prospective study of adult outpatients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in 11 European countries, recruited during 2020 and 2021 from primary care and the community. Structured follow-up by phone interviews (symptom rating, symptom impact on daily activities and general practice visits) was performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 by study personnel. Data was analysed descriptively by using correlation matrixes and Cox regression. RESULTS: Of 270 enrolled patients, 52% developed long-COVID and 32% post-COVID-syndrome. When only considering the presence of moderate or (very) severe symptoms at weeks 8 and 12, these percentages were 28% and 18%, respectively. Fatigue was the most often reported symptom during follow-up. The impact of lingering symptoms was most evident in sports and household activities. About half (53%) had at least one general practice contact during follow-up. Obese patients took twice as long to return to usual health (HR: 0.5, 95%CI: 0.3-0.8); no other risk profile could predict lingering symptoms. CONCLUSION: Long-COVID and post-COVID are also common in outpatients. In 32%, it takes more than 12\u2009weeks to return to usual health.",

        "abstract": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to exhibit pathogenic characteristics and be a possible cause of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines utilize a modified, stabilized prefusion spike protein that may share similar toxic effects with its viral counterpart. The aim of this study is to investigate possible mechanisms of harm to biological systems from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and vaccine-encoded spike protein and to propose possible mitigation strategies. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and 'grey literature' to find studies that (1) investigated the effects of the spike protein on biological systems, (2) helped differentiate between viral and vaccine-generated spike proteins, and (3) identified possible spike protein detoxification protocols and compounds that had signals of benefit and acceptable safety profiles.\u00a0We found abundant evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may cause damage in the cardiovascular, hematological, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immunological systems. Viral and vaccine-encoded spike proteins have been shown to\u00a0play a direct role in cardiovascular and thrombotic injuries from both SARS-CoV-2 and vaccination. Detection of spike protein for at least 6-15 months after vaccination and infection in those with post-acute sequelae indicates\u00a0spike protein as a possible primary contributing factor to long COVID. We rationalized that these findings give support to the potential benefit of spike protein detoxification protocols in those with long-term post-infection and/or vaccine-induced complications. We propose a base spike detoxification protocol, composed of oral nattokinase, bromelain, and curcumin. This approach holds immense promise as a base of clinical care, upon which additional therapeutic agents are applied with the goal of aiding in the resolution of post-acute sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination. Large-scale, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted in order to determine the relative risks and benefits of the base spike detoxification protocol.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections - coined Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - have been linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events after recovery. AREAS COVERED: our review aims to summarize the latest evidence on the increased thrombotic and cardiovascular risk in recovered COVID-19 patients and to examine the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the interplay among endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory response and coagulation in long-COVID. We performed a systematic search of studies on hypercoagulability, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation after SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPERT OPINION: endothelial dysfunction is a major pathophysiological mechanism responsible for most clinical manifestations in COVID-19. The pathological activation of endothelial cells by a virus infection results in a pro-adhesive and chemokine-secreting phenotype, which in turn promotes the recruitment of circulating leukocytes. Cardiovascular events after COVID-19 appear to be related to persistent immune dysregulation. Patients with long-lasting symptoms display higher amounts of proinflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon \u03b3 and interleukins 2 and 6. Immune dysregulation can trigger the activation of the coagulation pathway. The formation of extensive microclots in vivo, both during acute COVID-19 and in long-COVID-19, appears to be a relevant mechanism responsible for persistent symptoms and cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aging has been reported as a major risk factor for severe symptoms and higher mortality rates in COVID-19 patients. Molecular hallmarks such as epigenetic alterations and telomere attenuation reflect the biological process of aging. Epigenetic clocks have been shown to be valuable tools for measuring biological age in various tissues and samples. As such, these epigenetic clocks can determine accelerated biological aging and time-to-mortality across various tissues. Previous reports have shown accelerated biological aging and telomere attrition acceleration following SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effect of accelerated epigenetic aging on outcome (death/recovery) in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has not been well investigated. RESULTS: In this study, we measured DNA methylation age and telomere attrition in 87 severe COVID-19 cases with ARDS under mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, we compared dynamic changes in epigenetic aging across multiple time points until recovery or death. Epigenetic age was measured using the Horvath, Hannum, DNAm skin and blood, GrimAge, and PhenoAge clocks, whereas telomere length was calculated using the surrogate marker DNAmTL. Our analysis revealed significant accelerated epigenetic aging but no telomere attrition acceleration in severe COVID-19 cases. In addition, we observed epigenetic age deceleration at inclusion versus end of follow-up in recovered but not in deceased COVID-19 cases using certain clocks. When comparing dynamic changes in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), we detected higher EAA using both the Horvath and PhenoAge clocks in deceased versus recovered patients. The DNAmTL measurements revealed telomere attrition acceleration in deceased COVID-19 patients between inclusion and end of follow-up and a significant change in dynamic telomere attrition acceleration when comparing patients who recovered versus those who died. CONCLUSIONS: EAA and telomere attrition acceleration were associated with treatment outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with ARDS. A better understanding of the long-term effects of EAA in COVID-19 patients and how they might contribute to long COVID symptoms in recovered individuals is urgently needed.",

Subsequently, a series of downstream analyses were conducted to reveal the microbial characteristics of patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The blood microbiome at 12 weeks post-infection was most evidently disturbed, including an increasing ratio of Bacillota/Bacteroidota and a higher microbial alpha diversity. In addition, a group of pathogenic microbes at 12 weeks post-infection were identified, including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were positively associated with host genes involved in immune regulatory and olfactory transduction pathways. Several microbes, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae were associated with infiltrating immune cells, such as M2 macrophages. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights into the relationship between the blood microbiome and COVID-19 sequelae.

In this review, we highlight commonalities in the neurological impacts of influenza and COVID-19. We first focus on the common potential mechanisms underlying neurological sequelae of long-COVID and influenza, namely (1) viral neurotropism and (2) dysregulated peripheral inflammation. The latter, namely heightened peripheral inflammation leading to central nervous system dysfunction, is emerging as a shared mechanism in various peripheral inflammatory or inflammation-associated diseases and conditions. We then discuss historical and modern examples of influenza- and COVID-19-associated cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and fatigue, revealing key similarities in their neurological sequelae. Although we are learning that the effects of influenza and COVID differ somewhat in terms of their influence on the brain, as the impacts of long-COVID grow, such comparisons will likely prove valuable in guiding ongoing research into long-COVID, and perhaps foreshadow what could be in store for individuals with COVID-19 and their brain health.",

        "abstract": "Infants aged <1 year represent a seemingly more susceptible pediatric subset for infections. Despite this, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has not been proven as more serious in this age group (outside the very early neonatal period) than in others. Indeed, a considerable number of asymptomatic infections have been recorded, and the symptoms and morbidity associated with COVID- 19 differ minimally from those of other respiratory viral infections. Whether due to an abundance of caution or truly reduced susceptibility, infections in infants have not raised the same profile as those in other age groups. In addition to direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 diagnostic tests, laboratory markers that differentiate COVID-19 from other viral infections lack specificity in infants. Gastrointestinal presentations are common, and the neurological complications of infection mirror those of other respiratory viral infections. There have been relatively few reports of infant deaths. Under appropriate precautions, breastfeeding in the context of maternal infections has been associated with tangible but infrequent complications. Vaccination during pregnancy provides protection against infection in infants, at least in the early months of life. Multi-inflammatory syndrome in children and multi-inflammatory syndrome in neonates are commonly cited as variants of COVID-19; however, their clinical definitions remain controversial.

AIM: To investigate the prevalence and type of symptoms in those with a prior COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal observational study commenced in July 2020 investigating the longer-term health impacts of COVID-19. Participants were recruited via public health units and media publicity. Surveys were completed upon enrolment, and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Outcome measures included incidence of activity limitations and symptoms against health and vaccination status, age and gender. RESULTS: Overall, 339 participants were recruited. At 3 months after COVID-19, 66.8% reported symptoms, and 44.8% were still experiencing symptoms at 12 months. Fatigue was most common at every point (between 53.1% and 33.1%). Pain symptoms increased in relative prevalence over time, whereas respiratory/pulmonary-type symptoms decreased substantially after 3 months. Females and younger people were more likely to experience symptoms in the early stages of long COVID (P <\u20090.01) and those with more comorbidities in the latter stages (P <\u20090.001). Vaccination showed a statistically significant protective effect against symptoms (P <\u20090.01-0.001). CONCLUSION: Long-term COVID-19 symptoms exist among recovered patients up to 12 months after contracting the virus. Fatigue is a primary contributor, while chronic pain became more problematic after 6 months. Vaccination was a factor in preventing long-term symptoms and aiding faster recovery from symptoms.

        "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of dysautonomia in people with Long COVID, it is currently unknown whether Long COVID dysautonomia is routinely accompanied by structural or functional cardiac alterations. In this retrospective observational study, the presence of echocardiographic abnormalities was assessed. Left ventricular (LV) chamber sizes were correlated to diagnostic categories and symptoms via standardized patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires. A total of 203 individuals with Long COVID without pre-existing cardiac disease and with available echocardiograms were included (mean age, 45 years; 67% female). Overall, symptoms and PRO scores for fatigue, breathlessness, quality of life, disability, anxiety and depression were not different between those classified with post-COVID dysautonomia (PCD, 22%) and those unclassified (78%). An LV internal diameter at an end-diastole z score < -2 was observed in 33 (16.5%) individuals, and stroke volume (SV) was lower in the PCD vs. unclassified subgroup (51.6 vs. 59.2 mL, 95% C.I. 47.1-56.1 vs. 56.2-62.3). LV end-diastolic volume (mean diff. (95% CI) -13 [-1--26] mL, p = 0.04) and SV (-10 [-1--20] mL, p = 0.03) were smaller in those individuals reporting a reduction in physical activity post-COVID-19 infection, and smaller LVMI was weakly correlated with worse fatigue (r = 0.23, p = 0.02). The majority of individuals with Long COVID report shared symptoms and did not demonstrate cardiac dysfunction on echocardiography.",
        "reason": "The text presents a retrospective observational study analyzing echocardiographic abnormalities in individuals with Long COVID to determine if there is a relationship between Long COVID dysautonomia and structural or functional cardiac alterations. The analysis of previously collected data, the sample size (203 individuals), and the focus on relationships between certain factors and outcomes (symptoms, echocardiographic measures, physical activity) indicate that this paper falls under the Retrospective Study category."

        "abstract": "The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is a complex condition. While there are emerging studies on its effects in adults, there is scarce research regarding the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection among youth. Several researchers have likened long-haul COVID-19 to chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In adults, the prognosis for these diagnoses is less promising than that in youth; however, there is currently very little information available on the presentation of youth with PASC. A better understanding of the specific symptom presentation for youth diagnosed with PASC is necessary. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted collecting demographic data, COVID-19 symptoms and disease progression, and vaccination status. Additional data on referrals to a PASC treatment program and appointments attended were collected. Overall, data suggested that youth present with less severe PASC symptoms than adults, and the role of vaccination is unclear. These youth are often not referred to treatment programs. More exploration is necessary to continue to build an understanding of how best to aid youth diagnosed with PASC.",

        "abstract": "As time has passed following the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have gradually exhibited a variety of symptoms associated with long COVID in the postacute phase of infection. Simultaneously, in many countries worldwide, the process of population aging has been accelerating. Within this context, the elderly population has not only become susceptible and high-risk during the acute phase of COVID-19 but also has considerable risks when confronting long COVID. Elderly individuals possess specific immunological backgrounds, and during the process of aging, their immune systems can enter a state known as \"immunosenescence\". This further exacerbates \"inflammaging\" and the development of various comorbidities in elderly individuals, rendering them more susceptible to long COVID. Additionally, long COVID can inflict both physical and mental harm upon elderly people, thereby reducing their overall quality of life. Consequently, the impact of long COVID on elderly people should not be underestimated. This review seeks to summarize the infection characteristics and intrinsic factors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on the physical and mental impact of long COVID. Additionally, it aims to explore potential strategies to mitigate the risk of long COVID or other emerging infectious diseases among older adults in the future.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data on the natural trajectory of outcomes in survivors of COVID-19 beyond 2 years after symptom onset, and no evidence exists on the effect of re-infection in people with long COVID symptoms. We aimed to investigate the 3-year health outcomes of COVID-19 survivors and the effect of omicron re-infection. METHODS: In this single-centre, longitudinal cohort study, we recruited participants with confirmed COVID-19 who were discharged from the Jin Yin-tan hospital in Wuhan, China, between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. Participants completed three follow-up visits at 6 months (June 16 to Sept 13, 2020), 1 year (Dec 16, 2020, to Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021, to Jan 10, 2022) since symptom onset (reported previously). At 1-year follow-up, community controls without a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited from two communities in Wuhan and at 2 years were matched (1:1) with survivors of COVID-19 who underwent pulmonary function tests. We did a 3-year follow-up from Feb 23, 2023, to April 20, 2023, after the omicron (B.1.1.529) wave in winter, 2022. All eligible survivors of COVID-19 and community controls matched at 2-year follow-up were invited to the outpatient clinic at the hospital to complete several face-to-face questionnaires, a 6-min walking test (6MWT), and laboratory tests. A subgroup of survivors of COVID-19 identified by stratified sampling on the basis of disease severity scale score during hospitalisation and community controls underwent pulmonary function tests. Survivors of COVID-19 who received high-resolution CT and showed abnormal lung images at 2-year follow-up were invited for another assessment. We identified participants with and without long COVID at 2 years. The primary outcomes were sequelae symptoms, omicron infection, lung function, and chest imaging at the 3-year follow-up. FINDINGS: Of 1359 COVID-19 survivors who completed 2-year and 3-year follow-up, 728 (54%) had at least one sequelae symptom at 3 years after symptom onset and before omicron infection, mainly mild to moderate severity. During the omicron wave, participants with long COVID at 2 years had a significantly higher proportion of re-infection (573 [76%] of 753 vs 409 [67%] of 606 without long COVID; p=0\u00b70004), pneumonia (27 [5%] of 568 vs seven [2%] of 403; p=0\u00b7012). 3 months after omicron infection, 126 (62%) of 204 survivors with long COVID at 2 years had newly occurring or worse symptoms, which was significantly higher than the proportion in the non-long COVID group (85 [41%] of 205; p<0\u00b70001) and community controls (81 [40%] of 205; p<0\u00b70001), and not significantly different between COVID-19 survivors without long COVID and matched community controls (85 [41%] of 205 vs 81 [39%] of 206; p=0\u00b766). Re-infection was a risk factor for dyspnoea (odds ratio 1\u00b736 [95% CI 1\u00b704 to 1\u00b777]; p=0\u00b7023), anxiety or depression (OR 1\u00b765 [1\u00b724 to 2\u00b720]; p=0\u00b70007), EuroQol visual analogue scale score (\u03b2 -4\u00b751 [-6\u00b708 to -2\u00b795]; p<0\u00b70001), but not for reduced daily activity (0\u00b772 [0\u00b738 to 1\u00b737]; p=0\u00b732) at 3 years. Lung function of survivors at 3 years was similar to that of matched community controls. We found irregular line, traction bronchiectasis, subpleural lines and ground glass opacity at 3 years, but the volume ratio of lung lesion to total lung was only 0\u00b72-0\u00b73%. INTERPRETATION: Most long COVID symptoms at 3 years were mild to moderate, with lung function recovering to levels of matched controls. Survivors with long COVID had a higher proportion of participants with re-infection and newly occurring or worse symptoms 3 months after omicron infection than those without long COVID. Re-infection had increased symptom occurrence but not increased reduced daily activity. Although the organ function of survivors of COVID-19 recovered over time, those with severe long COVID symptoms, abnormal organ function, or limited mobility require urgent attention in future clinical practice and research.

        "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency has been studied in the context of acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), revealing associations with increased severity and mortality. Yet, the influence of vitamin D on long COVID symptoms remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of vitamin D on long COVID symptoms. Over the study period, 50,432 individuals within the catchment area of the outpatient COVID-19 clinic tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR, with 547 patients subsequently referred to a specialized Post-COVID Clinic, and 447 of them enrolled in the study. Patient-reported symptoms and paraclinical measures including vitamin D were evaluated in 442 patients. The majority of participants were female (72%, n = 320/442). The consumption of alcohol and number of current smokers were low. Low vitamin D was observed in 26% (n = 115/442) of the patients, most commonly in male participants (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.12, 2.79), p = 0.014). Additionally, low vitamin D was correlated with a younger mean age of 41 years (standard deviation (SD) = 12) as opposed to 48 years (SD = 13) in patients with normal vitamin D levels (OR = 0.96, 95% CI (0.94, 0.97), p < 0.001). While our study population indicated a potentially higher prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in this population compared to the general population, no significant differences in prevalence of symptom or symptom severity scores were observed between the low and normal vitamin D groups. In patients in a Post-COVID Clinic, we found no association between vitamin D levels and long COVID symptoms.",

We aimed to describe the impact of long COVID on work. METHODS: We co-produced baseline and follow-up online surveys with people with lived experience of long COVID (including three of the co-authors). Respondents were aged 18 years and older with self-reported long COVID following confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection who were not hospitalised in the first 2 weeks of illness. The baseline survey was administered in November, 2020, using convenience non-probability sampling through social media. Following informed consent, participants completed a follow-up survey at 1 year (November, 2021). Ethics approval was granted by the University of Southampton. FINDINGS: Of 2210 invited, 1153 (52%) participants responded to the survey (mean age of 47\u00b77 years [SD 10\u00b76], 965 [84%] female, 1096 [95%] White, and 892 [78%] holding a university degree). 54 participants (4\u00b77%) reported recovery at follow-up. Median duration of illness was 19\u00b78 months (IQR 19\u00b73-20\u00b71) at follow-up. An equal proportion reported being unable to work at baseline (20\u00b74%, n=235) and follow-up (20\u00b76%, n=237). However, a higher proportion reported being made redundant or taking early retirement at follow-up (8\u00b79%, n=102) than at baseline (2\u00b72%, n=25). 209 (18\u00b71%) reported losing or resigning or leaving their job due to long COVID at follow-up compared with 170 (14\u00b78%) participants at baseline. 307 (26\u00b76%) participants reported not taking time off-sick due to long COVID at baseline, decreasing to 122 (10\u00b76%) at follow-up. Of the 656 individuals reporting length of time off-sick, 354 (54%) were off-sick for more than 3 months, with 113 (17\u00b72%) off-sick for more than 12 months. Nearly half (47%, n=538) reported a loss in income. INTERPRETATION: The convenience non-probability sampling limits generalisability.

General fatigue is frequently observed in patients with long COVID during acute and post-acute phases. This study aimed to identify the specific risk factors for general fatigue in long COVID. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 aged over 18 years were enrolled in a multicenter cohort study at 26 medical institutions. Clinical data during hospitalization and patient-reported outcomes after discharge were collected from medical records, paper-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps. RESULTS: Among prolonged symptoms through 1-year follow-ups, general fatigue was the most interfering symptom in daily life. Patients with protracted fatigue at all follow-up periods had lower quality of life scores at the 12-month follow-up. Univariate logistic regression analysis of the presence or absence of general fatigue at the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups identified asthma, younger age, and female sex as risk factors for prolonged fatigue. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that asthma was an independent risk factor for persistent fatigue during the 12-month follow-up period. Longitudinal changes in the symptoms of patients with or without asthma demonstrated that general fatigue, not cough and dyspnea, was significantly prolonged in patients with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: In a Japanese population with long COVID, prolonged general fatigue was closely linked to asthma. A preventive approach against COVID-19 is necessary to avoid sustained fatigue and minimize social and economic losses in patients with asthma.",

Among the many discoveries borne from efforts to address the myriad clinical presentations across multiple organ systems was a common impact on tissues with cells that express the ACE-2 receptor. The vast majority of acute infections began and often ended in the respiratory tract, but more recent evaluations have confirmed significant extrapulmonary manifestations including symptom clusters that extend beyond the acute phase of infection collectively referred to as \"post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection\" (PASC) or more commonly as \"long (-haul) COVID\". Both acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and PASC are associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis and alterations in the gut-brain and HPA-axis in a subset of the infected. Mounting evidence suggests these extrapulmonary manifestations may ultimately lead to reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion as demonstrated following stimulation tests. Disrupted GH secretion could cause or exacerbate long lasting neuropsychological symptoms as seen in other similar manifesting conditions. Ongoing clinical research has shown promising improvement in PASC patients with fatigue and cognition complaints can be achieved via GH replacement therapy. GH stimulation testing should be considered in PASC workups and future research should delve deeper into the mechanistic effects of GH on acute COVID and PASC.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Pediatric severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are usually mild and the mortality rates are low, but concerns have been raised about long-term symptoms that may resemble other postinfectious syndromes. Studies with robust control groups and high response rates have been few. METHODS: We obtained identifiers for all 837 Icelandic children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by PCR between March 2020 and June 2021 and contacted them by telephone. We asked about 10 physical and mental symptoms being present at least twice weekly for at least 2 months. Participants who reported symptoms were contacted again a year later. For each subject who completed the questionnaire, an age- and sex-matched comparator without SARS-CoV-2 infection was asked to complete the same questionnaire, and the risk difference was calculated. RESULTS: Responses from 643 cases and 602 comparators were analyzed. Children who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to report one or more symptoms, except for anxiety/depression and sleep disturbances. Fatigue and loss of concentration were evidently more common in cases among teenagers (risk difference: 15%; 95% CI: 7-22% and 15%; 95% CI: 7-23%, respectively). At the second follow-up, close to a third of Long COVID cases had resolved but some participants had developed new persistent symptoms.

The capacity of antibodies to cross-neutralize a variety of viral variants may be associated with ongoing pathology and persistent symptoms. We measured longitudinal neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibody responses to pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants in participants infected early in the COVID-19 pandemic, before widespread rollout of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Cross-sectional regression models adjusted for clinical covariates and longitudinal mixed-effects models were used to determine the impact of the breadth and rate of decay of neutralizing responses on the development of Long COVID symptoms, as well as Long COVID phenotypes. We identified several novel relationships between SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization and the presence of Long COVID symptoms. Specifically, we show that, although nAb responses to the original, infecting strain of SARS-CoV-2 were not associated with Long COVID in cross-sectional analyses, cross-neutralization ID50 levels to the Omicron BA.5 variant approximately 4 months following acute infection was independently and significantly associated with greater odds of Long COVID and with persistent gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Longitudinal modeling demonstrated significant associations in the overall levels and rates of decay of neutralization capacity with Long COVID phenotypes. A higher proportion of participants had antibodies capable of neutralizing Omicron BA.5 compared with BA.1 or XBB.1.5 variants.

Physical therapy has been identified as a crucial aspect of the management of patients with long COVID, as it can help improve symptoms and overall physical function. The investigation of long COVID poses significant challenges due to the diversity and variability of symptoms, lack of clear diagnostic criteria, and limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of studies conducted in patients with long COVID in conjunction with interventions targeting respiratory function, particularly involving physical activity. To this end, we conducted a systematic review to analyze studies conducted on treatment programs for long COVID based on some form of physical activity. The protocol of the review was registered in the PROSPERO website, and the databases PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and WOS were searched. Of the 62 initial articles, six were included in the review. The results obtained have positive implications for the advancement of physical activity as a therapeutic intervention for individuals with long COVID-19 and the conceptualization of evidence-based treatment protocols.

The causes remain unclear. The present study investigated the presence of sleep disorders in patients with post-COVID syndrome using polysomnography. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with post-COVID syndrome and new-onset fatigue and sleepiness after a SARS-CoV2 infection underwent polysomnography in accordance with American Association of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standards as part of their clinical workup. Analysis was performed visually based on AASM criteria (scoring manual version 2.6, 2020). RESULTS: Polysomnography revealed a sleep efficiency of <80% in 50% of patients and a mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 9.9\u2009\u00b1\u200915.4/h. Excluding central apneas, 12 patients (35%) had an RDI of \u22655/h, pointing to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS; AASM 2014). Patients with a high RDI were significantly older (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and showed a trend towards a higher body mass index (p\u2009=\u20090.08) than patients with a normal RDI but had no other risk factors for OSAS. Six patients agreed to long-term treatment of their OSAS and all reported discontinuation of daytime symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, fatigue and memory and concentration problems may in part be a result of reduced sleep efficiency and sleep apnea in a relevant percentage of patients. This possibly treatable cause of the symptoms should be kept in mind in patients presenting with post-COVID syndrome.",

The effect sizes were large; the observed changes in throughput were equivalent to 10.6 years of normal aging and a 59.8% increase in the burden of mild cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline worsened with coronavirus disease 2019 severity and was concentrated in participants reporting post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was most likely associated with the observed cognitive decline, which was worse among patients with PASC or severe COVID-19. Monitoring patients with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 for declines in the domains of processing speed and visual working memory and determining the long-term prognosis of this decline are therefore warranted.",

        "abstract": "In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, and youth worldwide were suddenly confronted with unprecedented consequences. The first line of concern was related to the direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. While severe physical health symptomatology including death following infection was found to be less common in children than in adults,1 long-COVID has been identified in the pediatric population with the most prevalent manifestations involving mood symptoms, sleep difficulties, and fatigue.2 Secondly, the measures against COVID-19 carried their own set of risks. Many governments imposed national lockdowns, schools closed, remote learning started operating and social distancing measures prevented families from visiting public places or meeting people from other households. Isolation, disruption of everyday routines, and a sharp and dramatic decrease in physical activity and social interaction levels became the new reality experienced by children and adolescents of all age groups.3 Cross-sectional community studies on children and adolescents conducted early in the course of the pandemic indicated elevated levels of loneliness, anxiety, and behavioral problems in youth samples, even during the initial phases of the outbreak.4 Systematic reviews of mainly cross-sectional studies that followed indicated a significant rise in clinically significant anxiety and depression symptoms among children and adolescents compared to pre-pandemic levels5 and high prevalence estimates for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress symptomatology, and sleep disorders.6 A recent systematic review that included data from 55,000 children and adolescents from many countries of the world (mean age 11.3 years) reported that anxiety (range = 1.8\u201349.5%), depression (range = 2.2\u2013 63.8%), irritability (range = 16.7\u201373.2%) and anger (range = 30.0\u201351.3%) were frequently reported by children and adolescents during the pandemic.7 However, the experience of the pandemic was not homogenous among all youth. Possible risk factors included the presence of mental health problems before the pandemic, excessive exposure to media, and high COVID-19 caseload in the community, while the presence of any kind of family routines and good parent-child communication were identified as protective factors.7 Females and older adolescents were also reported to be at greater risk for adverse mental health outcomes. In most countries, the spread of the infection, on one hand, and the enforcement of lockdowns and other containment measures, on the other, have put health care under tremendous pressure, leaving families with children with mental health disorders with minimal or inadequate support. Nevertheless, differences were also observed within the group of children with psychiatric or developmental disorders diagnosed before the pandemic. Numerous studies that have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures on children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders reported a significant increase in parental stress, as well as high levels of anxiety, irritability, hyperactivity, stereotypical behavior, and other behavioral problems among children and adolescents.8 Further studies that investigated the issue of neurodevelopmental disorders showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately and adversely affected children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with a recent meta-analysis pointing to a global increase in ADHD symptoms.9 Finally, early concerns about a possible significant increase in suicidality among youth during the pandemic were followed by contradicting findings from relevant studies. On the whole, though, it is suggested that during the pandemic, as previously, higher rates of suicidal ideation than of suicidal behaviors and suicide events were reported among children and adolescents.10 Similar patterns of mental health difficulties to those described above have also been identified in youth in Greece. During the early stages of the pandemic, one-third (35.1%) of the parents reported that their child\u2019s psychological health was considerably affected,11 while a study of final-year high-school students found that the rates of severe depression and anxiety increased significantly during the lockdown.12 Among children and adolescents with pre-existing mental health problems from different parts of the country, no change was found in mood state scores pre- and post-pandemic onset, while several of their daily behaviors worsened during the lockdown, such as reduced sleep or time spent outdoors.13 Such research findings related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures should guide the follow-up of children and young people affected by it and inform the design of effective health strategies and policies in the post-pandemic era with the aim to prevent and mitigate further mental health crises.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, post-COVID syndrome (persistent symptoms/complications lasting >12\u00a0weeks) continues to pose medical and economic challenges. In military personnel, where optimal fitness is crucial, prolonged limitations affecting their ability to perform duties has occupational and psychological implications, impacting deployability and retention. Research investigating post-COVID syndrome exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary effects in military personnel is limited. METHODS: UK military personnel were recruited from the Defence Medical Services COVID-19 Recovery Service. Participants were separated into healthy controls without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (group one), and participants with prolonged symptoms (>12\u00a0weeks) after mild-moderate (community-treated) and severe (hospitalised) COVID-19 illness (group 2 and 3, respectively). Participants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and spectroscopy, echocardiography, pulmonary function testing and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). RESULTS: 113 participants were recruited. When compared in ordered groups (one to three), CPET showed stepwise decreases in peak work, work at VT1 and VO2 max (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). There were stepwise decreases in FVC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), FEV1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), TLC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), VA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and DLCO (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002), and a stepwise increase in A-a gradient (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). CMR showed stepwise decreases in LV/RV volumes, stroke volumes and LV mass (LVEDVi/RVEDVi p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; LVSV p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; RVSV p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; LV mass index p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). CONCLUSION: In an active military population, post-COVID syndrome is linked to subclinical changes in maximal exercise capacity. Alongside disease specific changes, many of these findings share the phenotype of deconditioning following prolonged illness or bedrest. Partitioning of the relative contribution of pathological changes from COVID-19 and deconditioning is challenging in post-COVID syndrome recovery.",

Therefore, we performed subgroup analyses of patients with COVID-19, classifying them into different groups. In this multicenter cohort study, using an original questionnaire, we examined patients (\u226518 years old) diagnosed with COVID-19 from November 2020 to March 2022 and hospitalized at participating medical facilities. In total, 1066 patients were registered (361 female, 620 male). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (n\u2009=\u2009344; 32.5%).

However, the impact of COVID-19 infection on women's menstruation is still unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and menstruation in premenopausal women. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Pre-menopausal women were invited to participate in the online questionnaire on wechat. Participants were divided into four groups according to whether they were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) and whether they had menstrual changes during the pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics, history of COVID-19, menstruation and menstrual changes of the participants were collected. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: A total of 1946 women were included in the study. 1800 participants had been or were currently infected with SARS-COV-2, and 146 people had not been infected. Among 1800 patients with COVID-19, 666 (37.0%) had changes in menstruation, and 1134 (63.0%) did not, which was significantly higher than the uninfected participants (c2\u2009=\u200912.161, P\u2009=\u20090.000).

However, after resolution of acute infection, patients may still have clinical sequelae, the so-called long-COVID-19, including thrombotic events again in the venous and arterial circulation. The mechanisms accounting for thrombosis in acute and long COVID-19 have not been fully clarified; interactions of COVID-19 with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 or toll-like receptor family or infection-induced cytokine storm have been suggested to be implicated in endothelial cells, leucocytes, and platelets to elicit clotting activation in acute as well in chronic phase of the disease. In acute COVID-19, prophylactic or full doses of anticoagulants exert beneficial effects even if the dosage choice is still under investigation; however, a residual risk still remains suggesting a need for a more appropriate therapeutic approach.

Lung fibrosis frequency in post-COVID syndrome is highly variable and even if the risk is proportionally small, many patients could be affected. However, there is still no data on lung extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in severe COVID-19 and whether it is different from other aetiologies of ARDS. METHODS: We have quantified different ECM elements and TGF-\u03b2 expression in lung tissue of 28 fatal COVID-19 cases and compared to 27 patients that died of other causes of ARDS, divided according to MV duration (up to six days or seven days or more). In COVID-19 cases, ECM elements were correlated with lung transcriptomics and cytokines profile. RESULTS: We observed that COVID-19 cases presented significant increased deposition of collagen, fibronectin, versican, and TGF-\u03b2, and decreased decorin density when compared to non-COVID-19 cases of similar MV duration. TGF-\u03b2 was precociously increased in COVID-19 patients with MV duration up to six days. Lung collagen was higher in women with COVID-19, with a transition of upregulated genes related to fibrillogenesis to collagen production and ECM disassembly along the MV course. CONCLUSIONS: Fatal COVID-19 is associated with an early TGF-\u03b2 expression lung environment after the MV onset, followed by a disordered ECM assembly. This uncontrolled process resulted in a prominent collagen deposition when compared to other causes of ARDS. Our data provides pathological substrates to better understand the high prevalence of pulmonary abnormalities in patients surviving COVID-19.",

In this sense, it is paramount to know the nutritional factors that may be related to the prognosis of the disease. Evidence shows that vitamin A may play an important preventive and therapeutic role in supporting respiratory infections as in COVID-19. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association of vitamin A (retinol) status with the prognosis of the disease. A case-control study from a cohort study was conducted in Brazil between May and October 2020. The study population was chosen by convenience, consisting of participants diagnosed with COVID-19. Recruitment was carried out using different approaches, including through dissemination on social media and in four hospitals in the city of Natal/RN, Brazil, recruiting participants from the COVID-19 ward and hospitalized participants who tested positive for the disease. The participants were allocated into two groups according to severity, with a group of mild (n = 88) or critical (n = 106) patients and compared to a control group (selected before the pandemic, n = 46).

Multiple genetic variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been detected since its first public declaration in 2020, some of them being considered variants of concern (VOCs) corresponding to several pandemic waves. Nevertheless, a growing number of COVID-19 patients are continuously discharged from hospitals, remaining symptomatic even months after their first episode of COVID-19 infection. Long COVID-19 or 'post-acute COVID-19 syndrome' emerged as the new pandemic, being characterized by a high variability of clinical manifestations ranging from cardiorespiratory and neurological symptoms such as chest pain, exertional dyspnoea or cognitive disturbance to psychological disturbances, e.g., depression, anxiety or sleep disturbance with a crucial impact on patients' quality of life. Moreover, Long COVID is viewed as a new cardiovascular risk factor capable of modifying the trajectory of current and future cardiovascular diseases, altering the patients' prognosis. Therefore, in this review we address the current definitions of Long COVID and its pathophysiology, with a focus on cardiovascular manifestations. Furthermore, we aim to review the mechanisms of acute and chronic cardiac injury and the variety of cardiovascular sequelae observed in recovered COVID-19 patients, in addition to the potential role of Long COVID clinics in the medical management of this new condition. We will further address the role of future research for a better understanding of the actual impact of Long COVID and future therapeutic directions.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of vitamin D (VD) in COVID-19 and long COVID-19, explain the discrepancy in clinical outcomes and highlight the potential impact of metformin on VD efficacy in recent articles. Articles from January 2022 to August 2023 were selected for this review. The objective of this study was achieved by reviewing, analyzing, and discussing articles demonstrating (1) the mechanism of action of VD (2) observational or randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that support or not the beneficial clinical effects of VD in COVID-19 or long COVID. (3) genetic and non-genetic reasons for the variation in the effects of VD. Articles were collected from electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Egyptian Knowledge Bank, Science Direct, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Twenty three studies conducted in vitro or in animal models indicated that VD may act in COVID-19 through protecting the respiratory system by antimicrobial peptide cathelicidins, reducing lung inflammation, regulating innate and adaptive immune functions and up regulation of autophagy gene activity. Our review identified 58 clinical studies that met the criteria. The number of publications supporting a beneficial clinical activity of VD in treating COVID-19 was 49 (86%), including 12 meta-analyses. Although the total patients included in all articles was 14,071,273, patients included in publications supporting a beneficial role of VD in COVID-19 were 14,029,411 (99.7%). Collectively, extensive observational studies indicated a decisive relationship between low VD levels and the severity of COVID-19 and mortality outcomes. Importantly, evidence from intervention studies has demonstrated the effectiveness of VD supplements in treating COVID-19. Furthermore, the results of 4 observational studies supported the beneficial role of VD in alleviating symptoms of long COVID-19 disease. However,\u00a0eight RCTs and one meta-analysis of RCTs may contain low-grade evidence against a beneficial role of VD in COVID-19. Twenty-five articles have addressed the association between VDR and DBP genetic polymorphisms and treatment failure of VD in COVID-19. Impaired VDR signaling may underlie the variability of VD effects as non-genetic mechanisms. Interestingly, in recent studies, metformin has a beneficial therapeutic role in COVID-19 and long COVID-19, possibly by improving AMPK signaling of the VDR and enhancing the efficacy of the VD. In conclusion, evidence has been significantly strengthened over the past 18\u00a0months, with several meta-analyses and RCTs reporting conclusive beneficial effects of VD supplementation against COVID-19 and highlighting metformin to improve VDR sensitivity and efficacy in treating COVID-19 and long COVID-19.",

        "title": "Risk of New-Onset Long COVID Following Reinfection With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: A Community-Based Cohort Study.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the risk of long COVID following reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We estimated the likelihood of new-onset, self-reported long COVID after a second SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to a first infection. METHODS: We included UK COVID-19 Infection Survey participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between 1 November 2021 and 8 October 2022. The primary outcome was self-reported long COVID 12-20 weeks after each infection. Separate analyses were performed for those <16 years and \u226516 years. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for new-onset long COVID using logistic regression, comparing second to first infections, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and calendar date of infection, plus vaccination status in participants \u226516 years of age. RESULTS: Overall, long COVID was reported by those \u226516 years after 4.0% and 2.4% of first and second infections, respectively; the corresponding estimates among those aged <16 years were 1.0% and 0.6%. The aOR for long COVID after second compared to first infections was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI], .63-.81) for those \u226516 years and 0.93 (95% CI, .57-1.53) for those <16 years. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of new-onset long COVID after a second SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that after a first infection for persons aged \u226516 years, though there is no evidence of a difference in risk for those <16 years. However, there remains some risk of new-onset long COVID after a second infection, with around 1 in 40 of those aged \u226516 years and 1 in 165 of those <16 years reporting long COVID after a second infection.",

However, little is known about postacute sequelae, referred to as Long COVID. METHODS: Prospective, single-center cohort study investigating prevalence and risk factors for Long COVID among kidney transplant recipients during the omicron predominance in Brazil. The analysis included adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 5, 2022, and July 18, 2022, were alive, had a functioning kidney transplant 3 mo after symptom onset, and answered a telephonic survey about physical complains of Long COVID. RESULTS: From the 1529 eligible, 602 (39%) patients responded the survey. Sixteen percent reported a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 85% had been fully vaccinated. The prevalence of Long COVID was 52%, with the most common complaints being weakness (46%), myalgia (41%), dizziness (33%), and headache (31%). Among employed patients, 94% were able to resume their normal work activities.

CONCLUSIONS: In the \"omicron era,\" Long COVID among kidney transplant recipients exhibited milder characteristics and had a less significant impact on their ability to resume normal life activities.

        "abstract": "Mast cells (MC) are ubiquitous in the body, and they are critical for not only in allergic diseases but also in immunity and inflammation, including having potential involvement in the pathophysiology of dysautonomias and neuroinflammatory disorders. MC are located perivascularly close to nerve endings and sites such as the carotid bodies, heart, hypothalamus, the pineal gland, and the adrenal gland that would allow them not only to regulate but also to be affected by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). MC are stimulated not only by allergens but also many other triggers including some from the ANS that can affect MC release of neurosensitizing, proinflammatory, and vasoactive mediators. Hence, MC may be able to regulate homeostatic functions that seem to be dysfunctional in many conditions, such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, and Long-COVID syndrome. The evidence indicates that there is a possible association between these conditions and diseases associated with MC activation. There is no effective treatment for any form of these conditions other than minimizing symptoms. Given the many ways MC could be activated and the numerous mediators released, it would be important to develop ways to inhibit stimulation of MC and the release of ANS-relevant mediators.",

Our objective was to examine Long COVID symptoms using a statewide population-based probability sample. METHODS: Among 8000 sampled adults with polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 between June 2020 and July 2021 in the Michigan Disease Surveillance System, 2533 completed our survey (response rate 32.2%). Using modified Poisson regression, we examined sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical predictors of eight Long COVID symptom clusters, defined as at least one applicable symptom lasting 90 or more days post COVID-19 onset. RESULTS: Neuropsychiatric Long COVID symptoms, including brain fog, were most prevalent (23.7%), followed by systemic symptoms (17.1%), including fatigue, musculoskeletal (11.4%), pulmonary (10.4%), dermatologic (6.7%), cardiovascular (6.1%), gastrointestinal (5.4%), and ear, nose, and throat symptoms (5.3%). In adjusted analyses, female sex, a pre-existing psychological condition, and intensive care unit admission were strong predictors of most Long COVID symptom clusters. Older age was not associated with a higher prevalence of all symptoms - cardiovascular and dermatologic symptoms were most prevalent among middle-aged adults and age was not associated with neuropsychiatric or gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, there were fewer associations between pre-existing conditions and cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and dermatologic symptoms compared to other symptom clusters. CONCLUSIONS: While many predictors of Long COVID symptom clusters were similar, the relationship with age and pre-existing conditions varied across clusters. Cardiovascular, neuropsychiatric, and dermatologic symptoms require further study as potentially distinct from other Long COVID symptoms.",

Even though many people recover from acute infection, there is rising concern regarding post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs), often referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or \"long COVID.\" The respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and endocrine systems are just a few of the many organ systems that can be impacted by this multifarious, complicated illness. The clinical manifestations of long COVID can vary among individuals and may include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cognitive impairment, and new-onset diabetes, among others.

The pathogenesis of long COVID should be clarified and potential biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment should be sought after. To reduce the burden of long COVID on people and healthcare systems around the world, the need for long-term monitoring and management of long COVID problems should be emphasized.

We aimed to systematically review and appraise the epidemiological evidence on allergic diseases as risk factors for LC. DESIGN: This is an initial systematic review. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection and data extraction using Covidence. Risk of bias (RoB) and certainty of evidence (GRADE) were assessed. Random effects meta-analyses were used to pool unadjusted ORs within homogeneous data subsets. DATA SOURCES: We retrieved articles published between January 1st, 2020 and January 19th, 2023 from MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, the WHO-COVID-19 database and the LOVE platform (Epistemonikos Foundation). In addition, citations and reference lists were searched. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included prospective cohort studies recruiting individuals of all ages with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were followed up for at least 12\u2009months for LC symptoms where information on pre-existing allergic diseases was available. We excluded all study designs that were not prospective cohort studies and all publication types that were not original articles. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (9967 participants, range 39-1950 per study), all assessed as high RoB, due to population selection and methods used to ascertain the exposures and the outcome. Four studies did not provide sufficient data to calculate Odds Ratios. The evidence supported a possible relationship between LC and allergy, but was very uncertain. For example, pre-existing asthma measured in hospital-based populations (6 studies, 4019 participants) may be associated with increased risk of LC (Odds Ratio 1.94, 95% CI 1.08, 3.50) and findings were similar for pre-existing rhinitis (3 studies, 1141 participants; Odds Ratio 1.96, 95% CI 1.61, 2.39), both very low certainty evidence.

        "abstract": "Long COVID is the name given to a syndrome comprising a wide variety of symptoms persisting more than 3 months after acute benign COVID-19, with a prevalence ranging from 10 to 80%. Symptoms are very close to fibromyalgia. Several studies showed that long COVID prevalence was much higher after the first wave of the pandemics and was associated to the fact of thinking having had COVID rather than having had really COVID. Thus, it was the stress of the first wave with the lockdown and not the consequences of the infection that probably induced this high frequency of long COVID. Numbers of studies tried to find objective biological abnormalities for explaining long COVID but none of them could be replicated and convincing. The concept of long COVID seems to be a repetition of history of medicine, in which the doctors and the society gave different names to fibromyalgia with the objective of trying to highlight the fact that fibromyalgia could be a somatic disease with a well understood pathophysiology and to avoid to focus on the psychosomatic aspects of the disease. In conclusion, \"to name is to soothe\" as said by Roland Barthes. However, \"Naming things wrongly adds to the world's unhappiness\" was saying Albert Camus. Thus, the term of long COVID, which suggests viral persistence of impaired immune response to the virus, is unappropriated and should be replaced by fibromyalgia-like post-COVID syndrome.

Second, we aim to identify additional psychosocial risk factors that contribute to the persistence of Long COVID, and compare them with risk factors for symptom persistence in other clinical conditions. METHOD: We will conduct an observer-blinded, three-arm, randomised controlled trial. A total of 258 patients with Long COVID will be randomised into three groups of equal size: targeted expectation management in addition to treatment as usual (TAU), non-specific supportive treatment plus TAU, or TAU only. Both active intervention groups will comprise three individual online video consultation sessions and a booster session after 3 months. The primary outcome is baseline to post-interventional change in overall somatic symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: The study will shed light onto the action mechanisms of a targeted expectation management intervention for Long COVID, which, if proven effective, can be used stand-alone or in the context of broader therapeutic approaches.

A more comprehensive approach to modelling the disease burden from long COVID, in relation to fatigue, can ensure that we do not only focus on what is easiest to measure; which risks losing focus of less severe health states that may be more difficult to measure but are occurring very frequently.

Analyzed data included heart rate, blood pressure, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv) in the middle cerebral artery, and capnography. The baseline supine hemodynamic data were compared with the data obtained at the second minute of the -10\u00b0 HDT. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of HDT on hemodynamic variables. RESULTS: The HDT was explored in seven POTS patients and an additional seven POTS patients without HDT served as controls. In the HDT arm, four POTS patients had overlapping diagnoses of myalgic encephalopathy/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and one patient had comorbidity of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). HDT lowered heart rate by 10% and increased end-tidal CO2 by 8%. There was no change in other cardiovascular variables. CONCLUSIONS: In the acute setting, HDT is safe. HDT reduces the heart rate presumably by modulating baroreflex by enhancing preload and stroke volume, which in turn increases thoracic blood volume with a net effect of parasympathetic cardiovagal activation and/or sympathetic withdrawal. This pilot study provides a foundation to proceed with longitudinal studies exploring the long-term effect of repetitive HDT in conditions associated with preload failure such as POTS, ME/CSF, and PASC.",

After a year, chronic fatigue, dysautonomia and neurological and neuropsychiatric complaints predominate. In this study, 95 PCS patients were treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This study used an exploratory questionnaire and found that two-thirds of patients had a reasonably good to strong response on SSRIs, over a quarter of patients had moderate response, while 10% reported no response. Overall, patients experienced substantial improved well-being. Brainfog and sensory overload decreased most, followed by chronic fatigue and dysautonomia. Outcomes were measured with three different measures that correlated strongly with each other. The response to SSRIs in PCS conditions was explained by seven possible neurobiological mechanisms based on recent literature on PCS integrated with already existing knowledge. Important for understanding these mechanisms is the underlying biochemical interaction between various neurotransmitter systems and parts of the immune system, and their dysregulation in PCS. The main link appears to be with the metabolic kynurenine pathway (KP) which interacts extensively with the immune system. The KP uses the same precursor as serotonin: tryptophan. The KP is overactive in PCS which maintains inflammation and which causes a lack of tryptophan. Finally, potential avenues for future research to advance this line of clinical research are discussed.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought a conglomerate of novel chronic disabling conditions described as 'Long COVID/Post-COVID-19 Syndrome'. Recent evidence suggests that the multifaceted nature of this syndrome results in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary sequelae,chronic dyspnoea, persistent fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction being the most common, debilitating symptoms. Several mechanisms engender or exacerbate cognitive impairment, including central nervous system and extra-central nervous system causes, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients may suffer varying degrees of cognitive impairment, ranging from fatigue and brain fog to prolonged deficits in memory and attention, detrimental to the quality-of-life years post-recovery. The aim of this review is to understand the underlying mechanisms, associations, and attempts for prevention with early intervention of long-term cognitive impairment post-COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted through multiple databases such as Medline, National Library of Medicine, Ovid, Scopus database to retrieve all the articles on the long-term sequalae of cognitive dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inclusion criteria included all articles pertinent to this specific topic and exclusion criteria subtracted studies pertaining to other aetiologies of cognitive dysfunction. This search was carefully screened for duplicates and the relevant information was extracted and analysed. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: To date, the exact pathogenesis, and underlying mechanisms behind cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19, remain unclear, hindering the development of adequate management strategies. However, the proposed mechanisms suggested by various studies include direct damage to the blood-brain barrier, systemic inflammation, prolonged hypoxia, and extended intensive care admissions. However, no clear-cut guidelines for management are apparent. CONCLUSION: This review of the COVID-19 pandemic has elucidated a new global challenge which is affecting individuals' quality of life by inducing long-term impaired cognitive function. The authors have found that comprehensive evaluations and interventions are crucial to address the cognitive sequelae in all COVID-19 patients, especially in patients with pre-existing cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, the authors recommend further research for the development of relevant, timely neurocognitive assessments and treatment plans.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long COVID is a debilitating chronic condition that has affected over 100 million people globally. It is characterized by a diverse array of symptoms, including fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and respiratory problems. Studies have so far largely failed to identify genetic associations, the mechanisms behind the disease, or any common pathophysiology with other conditions such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) that present with similar symptoms. METHODS: We used a combinatorial analysis approach to identify combinations of genetic variants significantly associated with the development of long COVID and to examine the biological mechanisms underpinning its various symptoms. We compared two subpopulations of long COVID patients from Sano Genetics' Long COVID GOLD study cohort, focusing on patients with severe or fatigue dominant phenotypes. We evaluated the genetic signatures previously identified in an ME/CFS population against this long COVID population to understand similarities with other fatigue disorders that may be triggered by a prior viral infection. Finally, we also compared the output of this long COVID analysis against known genetic associations in other chronic diseases, including a range of metabolic and neurological disorders, to understand the overlap of pathophysiological mechanisms. RESULTS: Combinatorial analysis identified 73 genes that were highly associated with at least one of the long COVID populations included in this analysis. Of these, 9 genes have prior associations with acute COVID-19, and 14 were differentially expressed in a transcriptomic analysis of long COVID patients. A pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the biological pathways most significantly associated with the 73 long COVID genes were mainly aligned with neurological and cardiometabolic diseases. Expanded genotype analysis suggests that specific SNX9 genotypes are a significant contributor to the risk of or protection against severe long COVID infection, but that the gene-disease relationship is context dependent and mediated by interactions with KLF15 and RYR3. Comparison of the genes uniquely associated with the Severe and Fatigue Dominant long COVID patients revealed significant differences between the pathways enriched in each subgroup. The genes unique to Severe long COVID patients were associated with immune pathways such as myeloid differentiation and macrophage foam cells. Genes unique to the Fatigue Dominant subgroup were enriched in metabolic pathways such as MAPK/JNK signaling. We also identified overlap in the genes associated with Fatigue Dominant long COVID and ME/CFS, including several involved in circadian rhythm regulation and insulin regulation. Overall, 39 SNPs associated in this study with long COVID can be linked to 9 genes identified in a recent combinatorial analysis of ME/CFS patient from UK Biobank. Among the 73 genes associated with long COVID, 42 are potentially tractable for novel drug discovery approaches, with 13 of these already targeted by drugs in clinical development pipelines. From this analysis for example, we identified TLR4 antagonists as repurposing candidates with potential to protect against long term cognitive impairment pathology caused by SARS-CoV-2. We are currently evaluating the repurposing potential of these drug targets for use in treating long COVID and/or ME/CFS. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the power of combinatorial analytics for stratifying heterogeneous populations in complex diseases that do not have simple monogenic etiologies. These results build upon the genetic findings from combinatorial analyses of severe acute COVID-19 patients and an ME/CFS population and we expect that access to additional independent, larger patient datasets will further improve the disease insights and validate potential treatment options in long COVID.",

        "abstract": "There have been hundreds of millions of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the growing population of recovered patients, it is crucial to understand the long-term consequences of the disease and management strategies. Although COVID-19 was initially considered an acute respiratory illness, recent evidence suggests that manifestations including but not limited to those of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and musculoskeletal systems may persist long after the acute phase. These persistent manifestations, also referred to as long COVID, could impact all patients with COVID-19 across the full spectrum of illness severity. Herein, we comprehensively review the current literature on long COVID, highlighting its epidemiological understanding, the impact of vaccinations, organ-specific sequelae, pathophysiological mechanisms, and multidisciplinary management strategies. In addition, the impact of psychological and psychosomatic factors is also underscored. Despite these crucial findings on long COVID, the current diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on previous experience and pilot studies remain inadequate, and well-designed clinical trials should be prioritized to validate existing hypotheses. Thus, we propose the primary challenges concerning biological knowledge gaps and efficient remedies as well as discuss the corresponding recommendations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An improved estimation of the clinical sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in African countries, where the subject has received little attention despite more than 12 million reported cases and evidence that many more people were infected. We reviewed the evidence on prevalence, associated risk factors for long COVID, and systemic or sociocultural determinants of reporting long COVID. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, the Living OVerview of Evidence platform, and grey literature sources for publications from Dec 1, 2019, to Nov 23, 2022. We included articles published in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese that reported on any study type in Africa with participants of any age who had symptoms for 4 weeks or more after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded secondary research, comments, and correspondence. Screening and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Summary estimates were extracted, including sociodemographic factors, medical history, prevalence of persistent symptoms, and symptoms and associated factors. Results were analysed descriptively. The study was registered on the Open Science Framework platform. FINDINGS: Our search yielded 294 articles, of which 24 peer-reviewed manuscripts were included, reporting on 9712 patients from eight African countries. Only one study exclusively recruited children, and one other study included children as part of their study population. Studies indicated moderate to low risk of bias. Prevalence of long COVID varied widely, from 2% in Ghana to 86% in Egypt. Long COVID was positively associated with female sex, older age, non-Black ethnicity, low level of education, and the severity of acute infection and underlying comorbidity. HIV and tuberculosis were not identified as risk factors. Factors influencing reporting included absence of awareness, inadequate clinical data and diagnostics, and little access to health-care services. INTERPRETATION: In Africa, research on long COVID is scarce, particularly among children, who represent the majority of the population. However, existing studies show a substantial prevalence across settings, emphasising the importance of vaccination and other prevention strategies to avert the effects of long COVID on individual wellbeing, the increased strain on health systems, and the potential negative effects on economically vulnerable populations. At a global level, including African countries, tools for research on long COVID need to be harmonised to maximise the usefulness of the data collected. FUNDING: None.",

In contrast, in the United States, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) estimates that around 11\u00a0% of individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 go on to experience long COVID. The underlying causes of PASC remains under investigation, and there are no currently established FDA-approved therapies. One of the leading hypotheses for the cause of PASC is the persistent activation of innate immune cells with increase systemic inflammation. Naltrexone is a medication with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that has been used in other conditions that overlap with PASC. We performed a retrospective review of a clinical cohort of 59 patients at a single academic center who received low-dose naltrexone (LDN) off-label as a potential therapeutic intervention for PASC. The use of LDN was associated with a fewer number of symptoms, improved clinical symptoms (fatigue, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and abnormal sleep pattern), and a better functional status.

The condition is characterized by multiorgan system involvement with a wide range of symptoms that can vary in severity from mild to debilitating. Some of the common symptoms associated with long COVID syndrome include cardiovascular issues such as heart palpitations and chest pain; thrombotic events (eg, blood clotting disorders); metabolic problems (eg, type 2 diabetes); dysautonomia; paroxysmal orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome; reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus; the presence of autoantibodies; chronic spontaneous urticaria (hives); and connective tissue diseases. Whereas long COVID syndrome can affect individuals from various backgrounds, certain populations may be at higher risk such as individuals of Hispanic and Latino heritage, as well as those with low socioeconomic status, although approximately one-third of affected patients have no known risk factors or preexisting conditions. Many survivors of COVID-19 struggle with multiple symptoms, increased disability, reduced function, and poor quality of life. Whereas vaccination has been the most significant intervention able to decrease the severity of acute SARS-Cov2 infection and curtail deaths, limited data are available related to its modulating effect on long COVID necessitating the need for further investigation. Furthermore, several inflammatory pathways have been proposed for the pathogenesis of long COVID that are the targets for ongoing clinical studies evaluating novel pharmacological agents.

However, the biological processes that are associated with the development and persistence of these symptoms are unclear. Here 275 individuals with or without long COVID were enrolled in a cross-sectional study that included multidimensional immune phenotyping and unbiased machine learning methods to identify biological features associated with long COVID. Marked differences were noted in circulating myeloid and lymphocyte populations relative to the matched controls, as well as evidence of exaggerated humoral responses directed against SARS-CoV-2 among participants with long COVID. Furthermore, higher antibody responses directed against non-SARS-CoV-2 viral pathogens were observed among individuals with long COVID, particularly Epstein-Barr virus. Levels of soluble immune mediators and hormones varied among groups, with cortisol levels being lower among participants with long COVID.

The underlying cellular and molecular etiology remain poorly defined but growing evidence links PASC to abnormal immune responses and/or poor organ recovery post-infection. Yet, the precise mechanisms driving non-resolving inflammation and impaired tissue repair in the context of PASC remain unclear. With insights from three independent clinical cohorts of PASC patients with abnormal lung function and/or viral infection-mediated pulmonary fibrosis, we established a clinically relevant mouse model of post-viral lung sequelae to investigate the pathophysiology of respiratory PASC. By employing a combination of spatial transcriptomics and imaging, we identified dysregulated proximal interactions between immune cells and epithelial progenitors unique to the fibroproliferation in respiratory PASC but not acute COVID-19 or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Specifically, we found a central role for lung-resident CD8+ T cell-macrophage interactions in maintaining Krt8hi transitional and ectopic Krt5+ basal cell progenitors, thus impairing alveolar regeneration and driving fibrotic sequelae after acute viral pneumonia. Mechanistically, CD8+ T cell derived IFN-\u03b3 and TNF stimulated lung macrophages to chronically release IL-1\u03b2, resulting in the abnormal accumulation of dysplastic epithelial progenitors and fibrosis. Notably, therapeutic neutralization of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF, or IL-1\u03b2 after the resolution of acute infection resulted in markedly improved alveolar regeneration and restoration of pulmonary function. Together, our findings implicate a dysregulated immune-epithelial progenitor niche in driving respiratory PASC. Moreover, in contrast to other approaches requiring early intervention, we highlight therapeutic strategies to rescue fibrotic disease in the aftermath of respiratory viral infections, addressing the current unmet need in the clinical management of PASC and post-viral disease.",

Female sex protects against complications of infection; females are less likely to experience severe illness or death, although their risk for postacute sequelae of COVID-19 (\"long COVID\") is higher than in males. Despite the important role of the heart in COVID-19 outcomes, molecular elements in the heart impacted by SARS-CoV-2 are poorly understood. Similarly, the role sex has on the myocardial effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been investigated at a molecular level. We intranasally inoculated female and male ferrets with SARS-CoV-2 and assessed myocardial stress signals, inflammation, and the innate immune response for 14 days. Myocardial phosphorylated GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 decreased at day 2 postinfection (pi) in male ferrets, whereas females showed no changes. Myocardial levels of p62/SQSTM1 decreased in male ferrets at days 2, 7, and 14 pi while lower baseline levels in females increased on day 2. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased in cardiomyocyte nuclei in females on days 2 and 14 pi, whereas male ferrets had no changes. Only hearts from females increased fibrosis on day 14 pi. Immune and inflammation markers increased in hearts, with some sex differences. These results are the first to identify myocardial stress responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveal sex differences that may contribute to differential outcomes. Future research is required to define the pathways involving these stress signals to fully understand the myocardial effects of COVID-19 and identify targets that mitigate cardiac injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cardiovascular disease is a leading risk factor for severe COVID-19, and cardiovascular pathologies are among the most common adverse outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For those with post-COVID-19 conditions (PCC) or long COVID, the impact of COVID-19 vaccination on the evolution of symptoms, immune responses, and viral persistence is unclear. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, we evaluated the number of PCC symptoms, affected organ systems, and psychological well-being scores before and after patients with PCC received COVID-19 vaccination. We simultaneously evaluated biomarkers of systemic inflammation and levels of plasma cytokines/chemokines. We measured plasma and intracellular levels of SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and immunoreactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens in blood. RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination was associated with decreases in number of PCC symptoms (pre-vaccination: 6.56 \u00b1 3.1 vs post-vaccination: 3.92 \u00b1 4.02; P\u00a0<0.001) and affected organ systems (pre-vaccination: 3.19 \u00b1 1.04 vs post-vaccination: 1.89 \u00b1 1.12; P\u00a0<0.001), and increases in World Health Organization (WHO)-5 Well-Being Index Scores (pre-vaccination: 42.67 \u00b1 22.76 vs post-vaccination: 56.15 \u00b1 22.83; P\u00a0<0.001).

PCC participants presented a certain level of immunoreactivity toward SARS-CoV-2, that was boosted with vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen persisted in the blood of PCC participants, mostly in non-classical monocytes, regardless of participants receiving vaccination.

Long COVID is a new and complex chronic health condition that typically includes multiple symptoms that cross organ systems and fluctuate over time; a one-size-fits-all approach is, therefore, not likely to be appropriate nor relevant for long COVID treatment. 'Treatable Traits' is a personalized medicine approach, purpose-built to address the complexity and heterogeneity of complex chronic conditions. This comprehensive review aimed to understand how a treatable traits approach could be applied to long COVID, by first identifying the most prevalent long COVID treatable traits and then the available evidence for strategies to target these traits. An umbrella review of 22 systematic reviews identified 34 symptoms and complications common with long COVID, grouped into eight long COVID treatable trait clusters: neurological, chest, psychological, pain, fatigue, sleep impairment, functional impairment and other. A systematic review of randomized control trials identified 18 studies that explored different intervention approaches for long COVID prevention (k\u2009=\u20094) or management (k\u2009=\u200914). While a single study reported metformin as effective for long COVID prevention, the findings need to be replicated and consensus is required around how to define long COVID as a clinical trial endpoint. For long COVID management, current evidence supports exercise training or respiratory muscle training for long COVID treatable traits in the chest and functional limitation clusters. While there are studies exploring interventions targeting other long COVID treatable traits, further high-quality RCTs are needed, particularly targeting treatable traits in the clusters of fatigue, psychological, pain and sleep impairment.",

Using the SomaLogic platform, SomaScan, the plasma concentration of >7000 proteins was measured from 92 unvaccinated individuals, including 48 NP patients, 20 COVID-19 convalescents (CC) without lingering symptoms, and 24 unexposed healthy controls (HC) to interrogate underlying pathobiology and potential biomarkers of PASC. We analyzed the plasma proteome based on post-COVID-19 status, neurologic and non-neurologic symptoms, as well as subjective and objective standardized tests for changes in quality-of-life (QoL) and cognition associated with Neuro-PASC. The plasma proteome of NP patients differed from CC and HC subjects more substantially than post-COVID-19 groups (NP and CC combined) differed from HC. Proteomic differences in NP patients 3-9\u00a0months following acute COVID-19 showed alterations in inflammatory proteins and pathways relative to CC and HC subjects. Proteomic associations with Neuro-PASC symptoms of brain fog and fatigue included changes in markers of DNA repair, oxidative stress, and neutrophil degranulation. Furthermore, we discovered a correlation between NP patients lower subjective impression of recovery to pre-COVID-19 baseline with an increase in the concentration of the oxidative phosphorylation protein COX7A1, which was also associated with neurologic symptoms and fatigue, as well as impairment in QoL and cognitive dysfunction. Finally, we identified other oxidative phosphorylation-associated proteins correlating with central nervous system symptoms. Our results suggest ongoing inflammatory changes and mitochondrial involvement in Neuro-PASC and pave the way for biomarker validation for use in monitoring and development of therapeutic intervention for this debilitating condition.",

        "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 in children presents with distinct phenotype in comparison to adults. Overall, the pediatric infection with a generally milder clinical course of the acute infection compared to adults still faces several unknown aspects. Specifically, the presence of a wide range of inflammatory manifestations, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), myocarditis, and long COVID in the period after infection suggests a particular susceptibility of some children upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Albeit peculiar complications such as long covid are less frequent in children compared to adults, research on the relationship between inflammatory syndromes and SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly evolving. \u00a0 \u00a0 Conclusions: new studies and findings continue to emerge, providing further insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies. In the present work, we revised current knowledge of the main factors accounting for such variability upon SARS-CoV-2 infection over the pediatric age group. What is Known: \u2022 COVID19 in children overall showed a milder course compared to adults during the acute phase of the infection. \u2022 Children showed to be susceptible to a wide range of post infectious complications including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), myocarditis, neuroinflammation, and long COVID.

The pathogenesis of Long-COVID is currently under heavy scrutiny and existing data on the role of auto-immune reaction to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are conflicting. METHODS: This monocentric, cross-sectional study included patients who suffered a mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 12\u00a0months prior to enrollment with (n\u00a0=\u00a072) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a058) Long-COVID diagnosis according to the German S1 guideline or with no known history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n\u00a0=\u00a070). While autoantibodies specific for the vasoregulation associated Adrenergic Receptor (ADR) B1 and B2 and the CNS and vasoregulation associated muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (CHR) M3 and M4 were measured by ELISA, neurological disorders were quantified by internationally standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: The prevalence and concentrations of evaluated autoantibodes were significantly higher in Long-COVID compared to the 2 other groups (p\u00a0=\u00a02.1*10-9) with a significantly higher number of patients with simultaneous detection of more than one autoantibody in the Long-COVID group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0419).

Among the well-known long-term complications of COVID-19, myocardial damage is a frequently encountered side effect. Yet there is a lack of data for identifying high-risk patients who are more likely to develop long-term cardiovascular complications following COVID-19. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the primary functional imaging modality in evaluating myocardial ischemia This study aimed to investigate the role of MPI in predicting myocardial ischemia in patients diagnosed with long COVID. METHODS: Subjects were selected from eligible long COVID patients and control subjects without a prior history of COVID-19 who were referred to the nuclear medicine department for stress and rest single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) MPI. All participants' past medical records and clinical, and demographic characteristics were scanned. In addition, patients undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) following SPECT MPI were documented and patients with critical coronary stenosis were identified. RESULTS: Our results revealed that long COVID patients had higher rates of abnormal summed stress scores compared to the control subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, serum CRP level, SPECT lung-to-heart ratio (LHR), and the presence of long COVID were independent predictors of ischemia. The presence of long COVID was the best predictor of ischemia among the aforementioned parameters (p\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that SPECT MPI provides comprehensive information on myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function in long COVID patients.",

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The participants were assigned randomly to either the functional exercise (FE) group or AE group, both including breathing techniques. The interventions lasted for 8\u00a0weeks with 3 sessions per week, and they were conducted through the Fisiotrack mobile phone application. Assessments were performed at baseline and after treatment, including testing fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale), dyspnea (London Chest Activity of Daily Living Scale), functional performance (30\u00a0Seconds Standing Test), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Questionnaire), and quality of life (European Quality of Life Scale). The perceived change after treatment (Patient Global Impression of Change Scale), the usability of the application (System Usability Scale), and the adherence to treatment were also examined after treatment. RESULTS: In total, 43 participants (FE group, n\u00a0=\u200921; AE group, n\u00a0=\u200922; mean age\u2009=\u200942.4 [SD\u2009=\u20096.5] years) completed the study. In the intragroup comparison, the FE group showed improved fatigue (-6.7 points; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-11.9 to -1.3), functional capacity (2.6 repetitions; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.3 to 4.9), and perceived stress (-4.9 points; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-9.1 to 0.8), while the AE group showed improved perceived stress (-6.2 points; 95% CI\u2009=\u2009-10.3 to -2.1). No significant differences in the intergroup effect were identified for the studied variables. Significant differences were observed in the Patient Global Impression of Change Scale in favor of the FE group compared to the AE group, and quality of life reached the minimal clinically important difference for both groups. The ease of use of the telerehabilitation tool was rated excellent in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both telerehabilitation exercise modalities are effective at improving stress symptoms and quality of life in patients with long COVID-19. For improving fatigue and functional performance, FE shows more promising results. IMPACT: FE or AE may be recommended depending on patients' symptoms, and both may improve quality of life and stress symptoms in patients with long COVID-19. Telerehabilitation may be an optimal intervention modality for the prescription of physical exercise in patients with long COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sex-determined differences are rarely addressed in the management of diseases, despite well-known contrasting outcomes between female and male patients. In COVID-19 there is a remarkable disparity, with higher rates of mortality and more severe acute disease in men compared to women, who are mostly affected by long COVID-19. Furthermore, whether androgens play a protective or detrimental role in COVID-19 is still a matter of debate. Hence, the adequate management of the disease, especially regarding men presenting acute disease aggravation, still needs important data to elucidate the interplay between sex hormones and host immune responses that drive the worse evolution in male patients. METHODS: A cohort of 92 controls and 198 non-severe and severe COVID-19 patients, from both sexes, was assessed for clinical outcomes, plasma steroids, gonadotropins, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and immune mediators, before vaccination. These data were correlated with the global gene expression of blood leukocytes. The androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway was investigated by transcriptomics and tracheal aspirate was obtained from severe patients for SARS-COV-2 quantification in the respiratory tract. The interplay among clinical, endocrine and immunological data deciphered the sex differences in COVID-19. Importantly, statistical analyses, using 95% confidence interval, considered confounding factors such as age and comorbidities, to definitely parse the role of androgens in the disease outcome. RESULTS: There were notable contrasting levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) throughout the disease course in male but not female patients. Inflammatory mediators presented significant negative correlations with testosterone, which was partially dependent on age and diabetes in men. Male subjects with severe COVID-19 had a significant up regulation of the AR signaling pathway, including modulation of TMPRSS2 and SRD5A1 genes, which are related to the viral infection and DHT production. Indeed, men had a higher viral load in the tracheal aspirate and levels of DHT were associated with increased relative risk of death. In contrast, the testosterone hormone, which was notably reduced in severe disease, was significantly related with susceptibility to COVID-19 worsening in male patients. Secondary hypogonadism was ruled out in the male severe COVID-19 subjects, as FSH, LH, and SHBG levels were not significantly altered. Instead, these subjects tended to have increased gonadotropin levels. Most interestingly, in this study we identified, for the first time, combined sets of clinical and immunoendocrine parameters that together predicted progression from non-severe to severe COVID-19 in men. One of the limitations of our study was the low or undetectable levels of DHT in many patients. Then, the evaluation of enzymes related to biosynthesis and signaling by androgens was mandatory and reiterated our findings. CONCLUSIONS: These original results unraveled the disease immunoendocrine regulation, despite vaccination or comorbidities and pointed to the fundamental divergent role of the androgens testosterone and DHT in the determination of COVID-19 outcomes in men. Therefore, sex-specific management of the dysregulated responses, treatments or public health measures should be considered for the control of COVID-19 pandemic.",

Although efforts are underway to further understand risk factors for Long COVID and identify strategies to prevent disease development entirely, implementation of treatment strategies is warranted to alleviate symptom burden among those affected. This review provides a rationale for exercise prescriptions tailored to the Long COVID patient based on the pathophysiology underlying this syndrome, as well as the previously demonstrated benefits of exercise training in other similar populations whose clinical manifestations result from cardiac deconditioning. Herein, we discuss methods to tailor exercise protocols, accommodating exercise intolerance and post-exertional malaise that may otherwise limit the ability to participate in a training protocol, as well as data demonstrating that a focused exercise prescription may effectively alleviate symptom burden in these patients. Long COVID results, in large part, from deconditioning, which may result from as little as 20 hr of inactivity.

Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is a part of pulmonary rehabilitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is some evidence of its efficacy in cystic fibrosis (CF) and, recently, in long COVID-19. We are not aware of studies on IMT in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). Our aim was to assess the effect of IMT on respiratory muscle strength and pulmonary function in PCD and CF patients. METHODS: A single center pilot study. Spirometry, lung clearance index (LCI), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured at baseline (visit 1), after a month of IMT with \u00aePOWERbreathe (visit 2), and at follow-up (visit 3). RESULTS: The cohort included 27 patients (19 PCD, 8 CF); mean age 18.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8 years. After a month of IMT, there was a significant increase in MIP and MIP% (6.19-7.44, p\u2009=\u2009.015; and 81.85%-100.41%, p\u2009=\u2009.046, respectively), which was sustained at visit 3.

No significant changes were found in spirometry, MEP or LCI. CONCLUSIONS: IMT was well-tolerated and led to improved inspiratory muscle strength in PCD patients.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Millions of Americans were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 early in the pandemic but could not get diagnosed with COVID-19 due to testing limitations. Many have developed a postviral syndrome (PVS) including neurologic manifestations similar to those with postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Neuro-PASC). Owing to those circumstances, proof of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not required for evaluation at Northwestern Medicine's Neuro COVID-19 clinic. We sought to investigate clinical and immunologic findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patients with PVS. METHODS: We measured SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins in 29 patients with PVS after suspected COVID-19, 32 confirmed age-matched/sex-matched Neuro-PASC (NP) patients, and 18 unexposed healthy controls. Neurologic symptoms and signs, comorbidities, quality of life, and cognitive testing data collected during clinic visits were studied retrospectively. RESULTS: Of 29 patients with PVS, 12 (41%) had detectable humoral or cellular immune responses consistent with prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Of 12 PVS responders (PVS+), 75% harbored anti-Nucleocapsid and 50% harbored anti-Spike responses. Patients with PVS+ had similar neurologic symptoms as patients with NP, but clinic evaluation occurred 5.3 months later from the time of symptom onset (10.7 vs 5.4 months; p = 0.0006). Patients with PVS+ and NP had similar subjective impairments in quality of life measures including cognitive function and fatigue. Patients with PVS+ had similar results in objective cognitive measures of processing speed, attention, and executive function and better results in working memory than patients with NP. DISCUSSION: Antibody and T-cell assays showed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure in approximately 40% of the PVS group. Three-quarters of patients with PVS+ had detectable anti-Nucleocapsid and one-half anti-Spike responses, highlighting the importance of multitargeted COVID-19 immunologic evaluation and the limitations of commercially available diagnostic tests. Despite their persistent symptoms, lack of COVID-19 diagnosis likely delayed clinical care in patients with PVS. Our data suggest that millions of Americans presenting with PVS resembling Neuro-PASC were indeed exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the pandemic, and they deserve the same access to care and inclusion in research studies as patients with NP with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.",

The present study examined associations between post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) and serious psychological distress during young adulthood, and tested whether prior mental health diagnosis moderated this association. METHODS: Participants were 44,652 young adults who completed the Spring 2022 administration of the American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment III (ACHA-NCHA). Blockwise logistic regressions tested the odds of meeting the clinical threshold for serious psychological distress. RESULTS: PASC was associated with 53\u00a0% increased likelihood of meeting the clinical threshold for serious psychological distress. Among young adults with a prior mental health diagnosis, PASC predicted 36\u00a0% increased odds of serious psychological distress; among those without a diagnosis, PASC predicted 81\u00a0% increased odds. LIMITATIONS: PASC was assessed using a single self-report item rather than a clinical diagnosis of specific symptomatology. The analyses were cross-sectional and relied on concurrent reports of PASC and psychological distress which precluded us from making claims regarding directionality of the associations. The outcome of generalized psychological distress limited us from generating targeted treatment recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: PASC may confer elevated psychological distress among young adults.

None of the explants exhibited a usual interstitial pneumonia\u00a0pattern of fibrosis. Other parenchymal changes included multinucleated giant cells (n\u00a0=\u00a017), hemosiderosis (n\u00a0=\u00a016), peribronchiolar metaplasia (n\u00a0=\u00a019), obliterative bronchiolitis (n\u00a0=\u00a06), and microscopic honeycombing (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Vascular abnormalities included thrombosis of a lobar artery (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and microscopic thrombi in small vessels (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Systematic literature review identified 7 articles reporting the presence in 12 patients of interstitial fibrosis showing the NSIP pattern (n\u00a0=\u00a03), organizing pneumonia/diffuse alveolar damage\u00a0(n\u00a0=\u00a04) and not otherwise specified (n\u00a0=\u00a03) patterns. All but one of these studies also reported the presence of multinucleated giant cells and none of the studies reported the presence of severe vascular abnormalities. PA-COVID patients undergoing BOLT show a pattern of fibrosis that resembles a mixed cellular-fibrotic NSIP pattern and generally lack severe vascular complications. As the NSIP pattern of fibrosis is often associated with autoimmune diseases, additional studies are needed to understand the mechanism of disease and learn whether this information can be used for therapeutic purposes.",
        "reason": "The abstract mentions analysis of specific pathways (NSIP pattern of fibrosis) in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome and integrates both wet lab experiments (lung explants) and review of literature. The focus is on elucidating the relationship between certain pathways (NSIP pattern of fibrosis) and diseases (post-acute COVID-19 syndrome), as well as their regulatory interactions with other pathways."

These symptoms persist long after the acute infection has healed and is called \"long COVID\". Interestingly, there have been a series of reports that SARS-CoV-2 infections trigger the development of various autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory arthritis, myositis, vasculitis. Here, we report a novel case of SLE characterized by persistent pleural effusion and lymphopenia following SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is the first case in the Western Pacific region to our knowledge. Furthermore, we reviewed 10 similar cases including our case. By looking at the characteristics of each case, we found that serositis and lymphopenia are common features of SLE following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our finding suggests that patients with prolonged pleural effusion and/or lymphopenia after COVID-19 should be checked for autoantibodies.",

        "abstract": "Long-coronavirus disease (COVID) is an ill-defined set of symptoms persisting in patients following infection with COVID-19 that range from any combination of persistent breathing difficulties to anosmia, impaired attention, memory, fatigue, or pain. Recently, noninvasive transcutaneous electrical brain stimulation techniques have been showing early signs of success in addressing some of these complaints. We postulate that the use of a stimulation technique with transcranial magnetic stimulation may also similarly be effective. A 36-year-old male suffering from symptoms of dyspnea, anosmia, and \"brain fog\" for 2 years following coronavirus infection was treated with 10 sessions of Electro-Magnetic Brain Pulse (EMBP\u00ae), a personalized transcranial magnetic stimulation protocol guided by the patient's electroencephalograph (EEG). At the conclusion of the treatment, the patient had improvements in mood, sense of smell, and brain fogging. Dyspnea also decreased with a gain of 11% forced expiratory volume 1/forced vital capacity. A high-sensitivity athletic training cognitive test showed an overall 27% increase in aggregate score. A significant portion of this was attributed to changes in visual clarity and decision-making speed. Post-treatment EEG showed a shift from predominantly delta waves to more synchronized alpha wave patterns during the resting state. Brain stimulation techniques appear to be showing early signs of success with long-COVID symptoms. This is the first case describing the use of a magnetic stimulation technique with quantitative test results and recorded EEG changes. Given the early success in this patient with cognition, dyspnea, and anosmia, this noninvasive treatment modality warrants further research.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Persistent and new-onset symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection (so-called Long/Post-COVID syndrome) represent a major challenge for our healthcare system. However, there have been limited data on primary outpatient care and care planning, complicating patient flow management and ultimately patient care. Assessing the care reality of patients with Long/Post-COVID-symptoms, as well as their difficulties and desires in receiving medical care, is a necessary first step toward improving outpatient care. METHODS: The JenUP study (Jena study on the population-based incidence of Post-COVID complaints) is a questionnaire-based survey of all adults in the city of Jena who were registered with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 2020 and September 2021. Part of this study focused on the medical care of the affected persons as well as subjective difficulties of the patients in the context of treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1,008 of the 4,209 individuals responded to the questionnaire; 922 (91,5%) experienced at least one Long/Post-COVID-associated symptom. 85,6% of these individuals (790/922) also provided detailed information about contacts with health care facilities. Three out of four persons (590/790) consulted their general practitioner/family doctor in connection with their complaints and 155/790 (19,6%) specialists in addition (most frequently mentioned were specialists in internal medicine - 7,1% (55/790)). Difficulties in obtaining a subjectively required therapy were mentioned by 22,6% (162/718). The main reasons were the patient's apparent feeling of \"not being sick enough\" (69/162) and a lack of a specialist consultant (65/162). 27% (247/919) of all subjects with Long/Post-COVID complaints expressed a desire for a specific consultant. CONCLUSION: Primary care physicians represent a central element of outpatient care for Long/Post-COVID patients. In addition, nationwide structures for interdisciplinary care should be established according to the national S1 guideline. Analysis of wishes for medical care and perceived barriers to accessing it represent a first step in improving outpatient care for Long/Post-COVID patients.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Long COVID is a term that encompasses a range of signs, symptoms, and sequalae that continue or develop after an acute COVID-19 infection. The lack of early recognition of the condition contributed to delays in identifying factors that may contribute toward its development and prevention. The aim of this study was to scope the available literature to identify potential nutritional interventions to support people with symptoms associated with long COVID. Methods: This study was designed as a systematic scoping review of the literature (registration PROSPERO CRD42022306051). Studies with participants aged 18 years or older, with long COVID and who underwent a nutritional intervention were included in the review. Results: A total of 285 citations were initially identified, with five papers eligible for inclusion: two were pilot studies of nutritional supplements in the community, and three were nutritional interventions as part of inpatient or outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. There were two broad categories of interventions: those that focused on compositions of nutrients (including micronutrients such as vitamin and mineral supplements) and those that were incorporated as part of multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs. Nutrients included in more than one study were multiple B group vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, and acetyl-l-carnitine. Discussion: Two studies trialed nutritional supplements for long COVID in community samples. Although these initial reports were positive, they are based on poorly designed studies and therefore cannot provide conclusive evidence. Nutritional rehabilitation was an important aspect of recovery from severe inflammation, malnutrition, and sarcopenia in hospital rehabilitation programs. Current gaps in the literature include a potential role for anti-inflammatory nutrients such as the omega 3 fatty acids, which are currently undergoing clinical trials, glutathione-boosting treatments such as N-acetylcysteine, alpha-lipoic acid, or liposomal glutathione in long COVID, and a possible adjunctive role for anti-inflammatory dietary interventions. This review provides preliminary evidence that nutritional interventions may be an important part of a rehabilitation program for people with severe long COVID symptomatology, including severe inflammation, malnutrition, and sarcopenia. For those in the general population with long COVID symptoms, the role of specific nutrients has not yet been studied well enough to recommend any particular nutrient or dietary intervention as a treatment or adjunctive treatment. Clinical trials of single nutrients are currently being conducted, and future systematic reviews could focus on single nutrient or dietary interventions to identify their nuanced mechanisms of action. Further clinical studies incorporating complex nutritional interventions are also warranted to strengthen the evidence base for using nutrition as a useful adjunctive treatment for people living with long COVID.",

Evaluating its subjective symptoms is difficult, and no established pathophysiology or treatment exists. Although there are several reports of long COVID classifications, there are no reports comparing classifications that include patient characteristics, such as autonomic dysfunction and work status. We aimed to classify patients into clusters based on their subjective symptoms during their first outpatient visit and evaluate their background for these clusters. METHODS: Included patients visited our outpatient clinic between January 18, 2021, and May 30, 2022. They were aged\u2009\u2265\u200915\u00a0years and confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection and residual symptoms lasting at least 2\u00a0months post-infection. Patients were evaluated using a 3-point scale for 23 symptoms and classified into five clusters (1. fatigue only; 2. fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, and forgetfulness; 3. fatigue, headache, insomnia, anxiety, motivation loss, low mood, and forgetfulness; 4. hair loss; and 5. taste and smell disorders) using CLUSTER. For continuous variables, each cluster was compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Multiple comparison tests were performed using the Dunn's test for significant results. For nominal variables, a Chi-square test was performed; for significant results, a residual analysis was conducted with the adjusted residuals. RESULTS: Compared to patients in other cluster categories, those in cluster categories 2 and 3 had higher proportions of autonomic nervous system disorders and leaves of absence, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID cluster classification provided an overall assessment of COVID-19. Different treatment strategies must be used based on physical and psychiatric symptoms and employment factors.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world unprecedentedly, with both positive and negative impacts. COVID-19 significantly impacted the immune system, and understanding the immunological consequences of COVID-19 is essential for developing effective treatment strategies. The purpose of this review is to comprehensively explore and provide insights into the immunological aspects of long COVID-19, a phenomenon where individuals continue to experience a range of symptoms and complications, even after the acute phase of COVID-19 infection has subsided. The immune system responds to the initial infection by producing various immune cells and molecules, including antibodies, T cells, and cytokines. However, in some patients, this immune response becomes dysregulated, leading to chronic inflammation and persistent symptoms. Long COVID-19 encompasses diverse persistent symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems. In the post-COVID-19 immunological era, long COVID-19 and its impact on immune response have become a significant concern. Post-COVID-19 immune pathology, including autoimmunity and immune-mediated disorders, has also been reported in some patients. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of long COVID-19, its relationship to immunological responses, and the impact of post-COVID-19 immune pathology on patient outcomes. Additionally, the review addresses the current and potential treatments for long COVID-19, including immunomodulatory therapies, rehabilitation programs, and mental health support, all of which aim to improve the quality of life for individuals with long COVID-19. Understanding the complex interplay between the immune system and long COVID-19 is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies and providing optimal care in the post-COVID-19 era.",

        "abstract": "During the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) outbreak, many people were infected, and the symptoms may persist for several weeks or months for recovering patients. This is also known as \"long COVID\" and includes symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, et cetera. The COVID-19 virus may trigger hyper-inflammation associated with cytokine levels in the body. COVID-19 can trigger inflammation in the joints, which can lead to osteoarthritis (OA), while long-term COVID-19 symptoms may lead to joint damage and other inflammation problems. According to several studies, sesame has potent anti-inflammatory properties due to its major constituent, sesamin. This study examined sesamin's anti-inflammatory, anti-osteoarthritis, and anti-COVID-19 effects. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro assays were used to determine sesamin's anti-inflammatory activity against the RAW264.7 and SW1353 cell lines. Sesamin had a dose-dependent effect (20 mg/kg) in a monoiodoacetic acid (MIA)-induced osteoarthritis rat model. Sesamin reduced paw swelling and joint discomfort. In addition, the findings indicated that sesamin suppressed the expression of iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) and COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2) in the RAW264.7 cell line within the concentration range of 6.25-50 \u03bcM. Furthermore, sesamin also had a suppressive effect on MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) expression in chondrocytes and the SW1353 cell line within the same concentration range of 6.25-50 \u03bcM. To examine the anti-viral activity, an in silico analysis was performed to evaluate sesamin's binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). Compared to the controls, sesamin exhibited strong binding affinities towards SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and human ACE2. Furthermore, sesamin had a higher binding affinity for the ACE2 target protein. This study suggests that sesamin shows potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity for drug development.",

        "abstract": "The clinical manifestations of acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 suggest a dysregulation of the host immune response that leads to inflammation, thrombosis, and organ dysfunction. It is less clear whether these dysregulated processes persist during the convalescent phase of disease or during long COVID. We investigated the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the proportions of classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes, their activation status, and their functional properties in convalescent COVID-19 patients and uninfected control subjects. We found that the percentage of total monocytes was decreased in convalescent COVID-19 patients compared to uninfected controls. This was due to decreased intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Classical monocytes from convalescent COVID-19 patients demonstrated a decrease in activation markers, such as CD56, in response to stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, classical monocytes from convalescent COVID-19 patients showed decreased expression of CD142 (tissue factor), which can initiate the extrinsic coagulation cascade, in response to LPS stimulation. Finally, we found that monocytes from convalescent COVID-19 patients produced less TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation, than those from uninfected controls. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a clear effect on the relative proportions of monocyte subsets, the activation status of classical monocytes, and proinflammatory cytokine production that persists during the convalescent phase of disease.",

Several studies have shown data in this regard but are limited by non-representative and small study populations, short duration since acute infection, and lack of a true-negative comparator group to assess assay specificity. METHODS: We evaluated adults with RNA-confirmed COVID-19 at multiple time points following acute infection (pandemic-era participants) and adults with specimens collected prior to 2020 (pre-pandemic era). Using once-thawed plasma, we employed the Simoa\u00ae (Quanterix) single molecule array detection platform to measure SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1, and nucleocapsid antigens. RESULTS: Compared to 250 pre-pandemic participants who had 2% assay positivity, detection of any SARS-CoV-2 antigen was significantly more frequent among 171 pandemic-era participants at three different time periods in the post-acute phase of infection. The absolute difference in SARS-CoV-2 plasma antigen prevalence was +11% (95% CI: +5.0% to +16%) at 3.0-6.0 months post-onset of COVID-19; +8.7% (95% CI: +3.1% to +14%) at 6.1 to 10.0 months; and +5.4% (95% CI: +0.42% to +10%) at 10.1-14.1 months. Hospitalization for acute COVID-19 and, among the non-hospitalized, worse self-reported health during acute COVID-19 were associated with greater post-acute phase antigen detection. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to uninfected persons, there is an excess prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals up to 14 months after acute COVID-19. These findings motivate an urgent research agenda regarding the short-term and long-term clinical manifestations of this viral persistence.",

So far, however, no studies are available from Germany on the course after PR, nor on possible course differences between the two Long COVID subgroups \"Ongoing symptomatic COVID-19\" and \"Post-COVID-19 syndrome\" (PCS). METHODS: \u2002 In a prospective observational study, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) regarding exertional dyspnea, quality of life, pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety were assessed at the beginning of PR (T1), end of PR (T2), and after 3 (T3) and 6 months (T4). Statistical analyses were performed using latent difference models. RESULTS: \u2002 There were 224 rehabilitation patients (MAge=54.4; SDAge=10.4; 42.0% female) included in the study. During PR, all PROs improved significantly. After PR, improvements either persisted with large pre-post effect sizes (exertional dyspnea, quality of life), decreased slightly to small pre-post effect sizes (depression, fatigue), or decreased to baseline levels (anxiety, pain). PCS patients had greater burdens in depression, fatigue, and pain at baseline, but did not differ in trajectories. Indicators of the severity of the preceding acute phase (oxygen therapy, ICU treatment, ventilation) were associated with higher burdens at T0 in depression, fatigue, and pain, but not with the courses during and after PR. In contrast, female patients showed higher burdens in both depression and fatigue at T1 and higher pre-post effects than male patients. CONCLUSION: \u2002 The fact that improvements in PROs occurred in both subgroups only during PR, but not during the follow-up period suggests that the changes are not due to the natural healing process but at least partly due to PR. Moreover, the results suggest that both patient groups may benefit from PR. Persisting improvements in exertional dyspnea and quality of life and, to a reduced extent, in depression and fatigue until 6 months after PR, but not in pain and anxiety warrant study of additional multimodal interventions that may be needed to maintain these effects.",

Little is known about the association between inflammatory biomarkers, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the acute phase, and persistent symptoms after hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: IL-6, CRP, troponin-T, and ferritin were analyzed at admission for all patients with COVID-19 between September 1, 2020 to January 10, 2021. Survivors were followed up 3-months following hospital discharge and were asked to report persistent symptoms they experienced. Admission data were retrospectively collected. Independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed. RESULTS: In a sample of 144 patients (62.5% male, mean Age 62 years [SD\u2009=\u200913.6]) followed up 3 months after hospital discharge, the commonest symptoms reported were fatigue (54.2%), breathlessness (52.8%), and sleep disturbance (37.5%). In this sample, admission levels of IL-6, CRP and ferritin were elevated. However, those reporting myalgia, low mood, and anxiety at follow-up had lower admission levels of IL-6 (34.9 vs. 52.0\u2009pg/mL, p\u2009=\u2009.043), CRP (83 vs. 105\u2009mg/L, p\u2009=\u2009.048), and ferritin (357 vs. 568\u2009ug/L, p\u2009=\u2009.01) respectively, compared with those who did not report these symptoms. Multivariate regression analysis showed that these associations were confounded by gender, as female patients had significantly lower levels of IL-6 and ferritin on admission (29.5 vs. 56.1, p\u2009=\u2009.03 and 421.5 vs. 589, p\u2009=\u2009.001, respectively) and were more likely to report myalgia, low mood and anxiety, when compared to males. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that female patients present more often with lower levels of inflammatory biomarkers on admission which are subsequently associated with long-term post-COVID symptoms, such as myalgia and anxiety, in those discharged from hospital with severe COVID-19.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Almost twenty percent of adults with COVID-19 develop Long COVID, leading to prolonged symptoms and disability. Understanding the supportive needs of people with Long COVID is vital to enacting effective models of care and policies. DESIGN/METHODS: This qualitative sub-study explored the experiences of people with Long COVID and their unmet needs. Participants enrolled in a larger study to evaluate the post-acute cardiovascular impacts of COVID-19 were invited to participate in subsequent in-depth interviews. Participants were enrolled purposively until saturation at 24 participants. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: Participants focused on adaptations to life with Long COVID and their unmet needs in different life spheres. Three domains, 1) occupational and financial; 2) healthcare-related; and 3) social and emotional support, emerged as areas affecting quality of life. Although participants were motivated to return to work for financial and personal reasons, Long COVID symptoms often resulted in the inability to perform tasks required by their existing jobs, and unemployment. Those who maintained employment through employer accommodations still needed additional support. Participants encountered diagnostic challenges, challenges in accessing specialty appointments, insurance loopholes, high healthcare costs, and medical skepticism. Existing social networks provided support for completing daily tasks; however, those with Long COVID typically turned to others with similar lived experiences for emotional support. Participants found government support programs inadequate and difficult to access in all three domains. DISCUSSION: We propose a five-pronged policy approach to support persons with Long COVID. These overarching recommendations are (1) improve public awareness of Long COVID; (2) improve clinical care quality and access; (3) implement additional school and workplace accommodations; (4) strengthen socioeconomic benefits and social services; and (5) improve research on Long COVID.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has left many suffering from long COVID, an episodic and debilitating chronic condition affecting people's ability to work and manage medical expenses. Though the Biden Administration has committed to conducting research and building support programs to alleviate the strain on those affected, in practice, static eligibility criteria for unemployment and disability benefits, patchy insurance coverage, and insufficient paid leave programs have left many people vulnerable. Given the magnitude of long COVID and the dearth to date of large-scale studies about its financial consequences, a focused qualitative analysis of lived experiences is warranted to understand and highlight gaps in the policy landscape. METHODS: We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews from 2020 to 2022 with 25 people with experience of long COVID living predominately in the Midwest. RESULTS: Our inductive analysis revealed ways people became financially exhausted by uncertain medical care costs and precarious employment that left them trying, often alone, to access benefits. People described both experiences with workplace benefits and attempts to access federal benefits to address unstable employment situations created by protracted and uncertain functional impairments. DISCUSSION: We explore pre- and post-pandemic era unemployment, disability, and insurance policies and offer recommendations for better supporting people with long COVID.",

        "title": "A Review Article on Exercise Intolerance in Long COVID: Unmasking the Causes and Optimizing Treatment Strategies.",
        "abstract": "There is a growing body of research on SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), previously known as the post-COVID syndrome, a chronic condition characterized by symptoms that persist after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these symptoms, feelings of physical exhaustion and prolonged fatigue are particularly prevalent and can significantly impact patients' quality of life. These symptoms are associated with reduced overall physical capacity, decreased daily physical activity, malaise after intense training, and intolerance to physical activity (IFA). IFA, described as a reduced ability to perform physical activities typical for the patient's age, can often lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Prolonged physical inactivity can cause deterioration in the overall physical condition and disrupt mitochondrial function, triggering a vicious cycle of gradual symptom worsening. The underlying causes of PASC remain unclear; however, several biochemical mechanisms have been discussed to explain the body's energy depletion, and a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and cognitive rehabilitation and lifestyle interventions such as exercise and diet modifications has been suggested to improve the overall health and well-being of PASC patients. This critical review aims to review the existing research on the possible causes and links among chronic fatigue, reduced physical activity, and exercise intolerance in patients with PASC. Further research into the underlying causes and treatment of PASC and the importance of developing individualized treatment is needed to address each patient's unique health requirements.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In March 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak linked to mass gathering dinners at the Falles Festival in Borriana, Spain, resulted in an estimated attack rate of 42.6% among attendees. METHODS: In June 2022, we conducted a cross-sectional follow-up study of 473 adults aged 18 to 64 who attended the dinners at the Falles Festival in 2020, examining the cumulative experience after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination responses. Data included demographic details, lifestyle habits, medical history, infection records, and vaccinations from a population-based vaccine registry. Blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and cellular immunity. We employed a doubly robust inverse-probability weighting analysis to estimate the booster vaccine dose's impact on long COVID prevalence and symptom count. RESULTS: A total of 28.1% of participants met the WHO criteria for long COVID, with older individuals showing higher rates. Long COVID diagnosis was less likely with factors including O blood group, higher occupational status, physical activity, three vaccine doses, strong SARS-CoV-2-S-reactive IFN\u03b3-producing-CD8+ response, and infection during the Omicron period. Increased age, high or low social activity, underlying health conditions, a severe initial COVID episode, and reinfection were associated with higher long COVID likelihood. A booster dose, compared to one or two doses, reduced long COVID risk by 74% (95% CI: 56% to 92%) and symptom count by 55% (95% CI: 32% to 79%). CONCLUSION: Long COVID was prevalent in a significant portion of those who contracted COVID-19, underscoring the need for sustained follow-up and therapeutic strategies. Vaccinations, notably the booster dose, had a substantial beneficial effect on long-term infection outcomes, affirming the vaccination's role in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection consequences.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread panic and fear among the global population. As such, repurposing drugs are being used as viable therapeutic options due to the limited effective treatments for Long COVID symptoms. Ivermectin is one of the emerging repurposed drugs that has been shown effective to have antiviral effects in clinical trials. In addition, antioxidant compounds are also gaining attention due to their capabilities of reducing inflammation and severity of symptoms. Due to the absence of knowledge in pharmacogenomics and modes of actions in the human body for these compounds, this study aims to provide a pharmacogenomic profile for the combination of ivermectin and six selected antioxidants (epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), curcumin, sesamin, anthocyanins, quercetin, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC)) as potentially effective regimens for long COVID symptoms. Results showed that there were 12 interacting genes found among the ivermectin, 6 antioxidants, and COVID-19. For network pharmacology, the 12 common interacting genes/proteins had the highest associations with Pertussis pathway, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications, and colorectal cancer in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Disease analyses also revealed that the top three relevant diseases with COVID-19 infections were diabetes mellitus, ischemia, reperfusion injury. We also identified 6 potential target microRNAs (miRNAs) of the 12 commonly curated genes used as molecular biomarkers for COVID-19 treatments. The established pharmacogenomic network, disease analyses, and identified miRNAs could facilitate developments of effective regimens for chronic sequelae of COVID-19 especially in this post-pandemic era. However, further studies and clinical trials are needed to substantiate the effectiveness and dosages for COVID-19 treatments.",

This survey-based study examined differences in patient-reported COVID-19 symptoms, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) among groups of patients defined based on age and symptom-based long COVID status. Symptomatic, COVID-19-positive US outpatients were recruited from 31 January-30 April 2022. Outcomes were collected via validated instruments at pre-COVID, Day 3, Week 1, Week 4, Month 3 and Month 6 following infection, with changes assessed from pre-COVID and between groups, adjusting for covariates. EQ-5D-5L HRQoL and WPAI scores declined in all groups, especially during the first week. Long COVID patients reported significantly higher symptoms burden and larger drops in HRQoL and WPAI scores than patients without long COVID. Their HRQoL and WPAI scores did not return to levels comparable to pre-COVID through Month 6, except for absenteeism. Patients without long COVID generally recovered between Week 4 and Month 3. Older (>50) and younger adults generally reported comparable symptoms burden and drops in HRQoL and WPAI scores.

        "abstract": "Post Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC or Long COVID) is characterized by lingering symptomatology post-initial COVID-19 illness that is often debilitating. It is seen in up to 30-40% of individuals post-infection. Patients with Long COVID (LC) suffer from dysautonomia, malaise, fatigue, and pain, amongst a multitude of other symptoms. Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that often leads to functional disability and severe impairment of quality of life. LC and FM share several clinical features, including pain that often makes them indistinguishable. The aim of this study is to develop a metabolic fingerprinting approach using portable Fourier-transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopic techniques to diagnose clinically similar LC and FM. Blood samples were obtained from LC (n = 50) and FM (n = 50) patients and stored on conventional bloodspot protein saver cards. A semi-permeable membrane filtration approach was used to extract the blood samples, and spectral data were collected using a portable FT-MIR spectrometer. Through the deconvolution analysis of the spectral data, a distinct spectral marker at 1565 cm-1 was identified based on a statistically significant analysis, only present in FM patients. This IR band has been linked to the presence of side chains of glutamate. An OPLS-DA algorithm created using the spectral region 1500 to 1700 cm-1 enabled the classification of the spectra into their corresponding classes (Rcv > 0.96) with 100% accuracy and specificity. This high-throughput approach allows unique metabolic signatures associated with LC and FM to be identified, allowing these conditions to be distinguished and implemented for in-clinic diagnostics, which is crucial to guide future therapeutic approaches.",

DESIGN: A descriptive cross-sectional study that included a total of 88 patients; 60 patients with Long COVID-19 and 28 controls. Long COVID-19 diagnosis was established according to the World Health Organization criteria. Corneal confocal microscopy using a Heidelberg Retina Tomograph II (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed to evaluate sub-basal nerve plexus morphology (corneal nerve fiber density, nerve fiber length, nerve branch density, nerve fiber total branch density, nerve fiber area, and nerve fiber width). Dendritic cell density and area, along with microneuromas and other morphological changes of the nerve fibers were recorded. RESULTS: Long COVID-19 patients presented with reduced corneal nerve density and branch density as well as shorter corneal nerves compared to the control group. Additionally, Long COVID-19 patients showed an increased density of dendritic cells also with a greater area than that found in the control group of patients without systemic diseases. Microneuromas were detected in 15% of Long COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long COVID-19 patients exhibited altered corneal nerve parameters and increased DC density over 20 months after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings are consistent with a neuroinflammatory condition hypothesized to be present in patients with Long COVID-19, highlighting the potential role of corneal confocal microscopy as a promising noninvasive technique for the study of patients with Long COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19 disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), induces a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from asymptomatic cases to fatal outcomes. About 10-35% of all COVID-19 patients, even those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, continue to show symptoms, i.\u2009e., fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, and cognitive dysfunction, after initial recovery. Previously, we and others identified red blood cell precursors as a direct target of SARS-CoV-2 and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces dysregulation in hemoglobin- and iron-metabolism contributing to the severe systemic course of COVID-19. Here, we put particular emphasis on differences in parameters of clinical blood gas analysis and hematological parameters of more than 20 healthy and Long-COVID patients, respectively. Long-COVID patients showed impaired oxygen binding to hemoglobin with concomitant increase in carbon monoxide binding. Hand in hand with decreased plasma iron concentration and transferrin saturation, mean corpuscular hemoglobin was elevated in Long-COVID patients compared to healthy donors suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism. Although blood pH was within the physiological range in both groups, base excess- and bicarbonate values were significantly lower in Long-COVID patients. Furthermore, Long-COVID patients displayed reduced lymphocyte levels. The clinical relevance of these findings, e.\u2009g., as a cause of chronic immunodeficiency, remains to be investigated in future studies. In conclusion, our data suggest impaired erythrocyte functionality in Long-COVID patients, leading to diminished oxygen supply. This in turn could be an explanation for the CFS, dyspnea and anemia. Further investigations are necessary to identify the underlying pathomechanisms.",

AIM: This study endeavors to elucidate the potential interaction between chronic air pollution exposure and the manifestation of long COVID symptoms within a cohort based in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Participants included residents from the Makkah region who had recovered from COVID-19 between 2022 and 2023. A comprehensive questionnaire was utilized to gather detailed demographic data and assess the persistent symptoms seen during the post-COVID period. To gauge the environmental exposure to potential risk factors, air sampling for PM10 and PM2.5 was systematically conducted in various locations in Makkah over a year. RESULTS: Significant positive associations were found between PM2.5 and PM10 exposure and long COVID. Furthermore, specific symptom analysis revealed a significant association between air pollution and shortness of breath (for PM2.5). Only PM2.5 exposure remained statistically significant (RR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.67). In contrast, the association with PM10 remained on the cusp of significance, with an RR of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.61).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term symptoms after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (ie, post-coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] condition or long COVID) constitute a substantial public health problem. Yet, the prevalence remains currently unclear as different case definitions are used, and negatively tested controls are lacking. We aimed to estimate post-COVID-19 condition prevalence using 6 definitions. METHODS: The Prevalence, Risk factors, and Impact Evaluation (PRIME) post-COVID-19 condition study is a population-based sample of COVID-19-tested adults. In 2021, 61 655 adults were invited to complete an online questionnaire, including 44 symptoms plus a severity score (0-10) per symptom. Prevalence was calculated in both positively and negatively tested adults, stratified by time since their COVID-19 test (3-5, 6-11, or \u226512 months ago). RESULTS: In positive individuals (n = 7405, 75.6%), the prevalence of long-term symptoms was between 26.9% and 64.1% using the 6 definitions, while in negative individuals (n = 2392, 24.4%), the prevalence varied between 11.4% and 32.5%. The prevalence of long-term symptoms potentially attributable to COVID-19 ranged from 17.9% to 26.3%. CONCLUSIONS: There is a (substantial) variation in prevalence estimates when using different post-COVID-19 condition definitions, as is current practice; there is limited overlap between definitions, indicating that the essential post-COVID-19 condition criteria are still unclear. Including negatives is important to determine long-term symptoms attributable to COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05128695.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many people experience long-term symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive problems, or shortness of breath after an acute infection with COVID-19. This emerging syndrome, known as long COVID, is new and complex in many aspects. This study aims to collect the experiences of people with long COVID with ambulatory healthcare structures. METHODS: Four focus groups were conducted with a total of 23 adults with long COVID in June and July 2022. These discussions were audio-recorded, subsequently transcribed, and analyzed using the qualitative content analysis of Mayring and Kuckartz. RESULTS: Fourteen out of 19 participants who had a primary care encounter regarding their long COVID symptoms did not perceive it as helpful. Many respondents reported that their general practitioners did not take their long COVID symptoms seriously and did not refer them to specialists or made therapeutic recommendations. However, some participants reported that they were prescribed non-pharmaceutical therapies (e.g., group meetings supported by psychotherapists, occupational therapy, etc.) that improved their condition. 14 of 23 respondents perceived care barriers such as providers' lack of awareness of long COVID, poor access to specialists, a lack of specialized care (e.g., long COVID clinics), or high bureaucratic hurdles for specific healthcare services. To improve medical care, participants suggested campaigns to raise awareness of long COVID among healthcare providers and the general population, increase research and government investments regarding the development of treatment structures for long COVID, expanding existing therapeutic services, and establishing one-stop shops for integrated specialist healthcare for people with long COVID. CONCLUSIONS: Several implications for healthcare professionals and policymakers can be derived from this study: (1) general practitioners should take the symptoms of long COVID seriously, assume a care coordinating role, make referrals, and establish contact with long COVID clinics; (2) care planners should focus on developing interprofessional evidence-based care and treatment approaches for long COVID; (3) existing care structures such as long COVID outpatient clinics should be expanded.

The objective is to identify risk factors associated with PASC/long-COVID diagnosis. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study including 31 health systems in the United States from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). 8,325 individuals with PASC (defined by the presence of the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 code U09.9 or a long-COVID clinic visit) matched to 41,625 controls within the same health system and COVID index date within\u2009\u00b1\u200945\u00a0days of the corresponding case's earliest COVID index date. Measurements of risk factors included demographics, comorbidities, treatment and acute characteristics related to COVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost were used to determine the associations between risk factors and PASC. RESULTS: Among 8,325 individuals with PASC, the majority were\u2009>\u200950\u00a0years of age (56.6%), female (62.8%), and non-Hispanic White (68.6%).

However, the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its effects on long-term behavioral changes remain poorly understood. Using a highly virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain, denoted as SARS2-N501Y MA30 , we demonstrated that intranasal inoculation of SARS2-N501Y MA30 results in viral dissemination to multiple brain regions, including the amygdala and hippocampus. Behavioral assays show a significant increase in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors 14 days following viral infection. Moreover, we observed microglia activation following SARS2-N501Y MA30 infection, along with an augmentation in microglia-dependent neuronal activity in the amygdala. Pharmacological inhibition of microglial activity subsequent to viral spike inoculation mitigates microglia-dependent neuronal hyperactivity. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of infected brains revealed the upregulation of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways, implicating microglia-driven neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of neuronal hyperactivity and behavioral abnormality. Overall, these data provide critical insights into the neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underscore microglia as a potential therapeutic target for ameliorating virus-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities.",

        "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a significant global impact. While vaccines and treatments have reduced severe cases and deaths, the long-term effects are not yet well understood. Current models used for research, such as non-human primates and transgenic mice, are expensive and require scarce Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories, thereby limiting their practicality. However, the mouse hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1) mouse model offers a promising alternative. This surrogate model can be investigated in more widely available Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) laboratories. Furthermore, mice are affordable and easy to handle, and utilizing MHV-1 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 eliminates the need for costly transgenic mice. Importantly, the MHV-1 model successfully recapitulates COVID-19-related clinical symptoms, weight loss, multiorgan pathological changes and failure in acute stages, irreversible neurological complications, and other long-term organ dysfunction post-infection, which are similar to available human data post-COVID-19. To assist researchers in establishing and using the MHV-1 mouse model, this protocol offers comprehensive guidance encompassing procedures for animal preparation, induction of viral infection, clinical observation, pathological changes, and tissue analysis for mechanistic studies, thereby yielding valuable insights into disease mechanisms and progression. By adopting the MHV-1 model and the provided protocols, researchers can effectively circumvent financial constraints and the limited availability of BSL-3 laboratories, thus facilitating a more accessible and cost-effective approach to investigating the underlying mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and exploring potential therapeutic interventions. \u00a9 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to elucidate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of patients with long COVID (coronavirus disease 2019), especially focusing on 50% hemolytic complement activity (CH50). METHODS: This retrospective observational study focused on patients who visited Okayama University Hospital (Japan) for the treatment of long COVID between February 2021 and March 2023. CH50 levels were measured using liposome immunometric assay (Autokit CH50 Assay, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Japan); high CH50 was defined as \u226559 U/mL. Univariate analyses assessed differences in the clinical background, long COVID symptoms, inflammatory markers, and clinical scores of patients with normal and high CH50. Logistic regression model investigated the association between high CH50 levels and these factors. RESULTS: Of 659 patients who visited our hospital, 478 patients were included. Of these, 284 (59.4%) patients had high CH50 levels. Poor concentration was significantly more frequent in the high CH50 group (7.2% vs. 13.7%), whereas no differences were observed in other subjective symptoms (fatigue, headache, insomnia, dyspnea, tiredness, and brain fog). Multivariate analysis was performed on factors that could be associated with poor concentration, suggesting a significant relationship to high CH50 levels (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-5.49). Also, high CH50 was significantly associated with brain fog (aOR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.04-2.66). CONCLUSIONS: High CH50 levels were frequently reported in individuals with long COVID, indicating a relationship with brain fog. Future in-depth research should examine the pathological role and causal link between complement immunity and the development of long COVID.",

We aimed to analyse the COVID-19 infection rate, course and outcome, including mortality and long COVID, in people with anxiety, depressive, neurodevelopmental, schizophrenia spectrum and substance use disorders relative to control subjects without these disorders. METHODS: This study constitutes a preregistered systematic review and random-effects frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses. Major databases were searched up until 27 June 2023. RESULTS: Eighty-one original articles were included reporting 304 cross-sectional and prospective effect size estimates (median n per effect-size = 114837) regarding associations of interest. Infection risk was not significantly increased for any mental disorder that we investigated relative to samples of people without these disorders. The course of COVID-19, however, is relatively severe, and long COVID and COVID-19-related hospitalization are more likely in all patient samples that we investigated. The odds of dying from COVID-19 were high in people with most types of mental disorders, except for those with anxiety and neurodevelopmental disorders relative to non-patient samples (pooled ORs range, 1.26-2.57). Bayesian analyses confirmed the findings from the frequentist approach and complemented them with estimates of the strength of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Once infected, people with pre-existing mental disorders are at an elevated risk for a severe COVID-19 course and outcome, including long COVID and mortality, relative to people without pre-existing mental disorders, despite an infection risk not significantly increased.",

Our data showed 69 differentially expressed metabolites and six differentially expressed proteins between neuro-PASC patients and healthy individuals. Elevated sphinganine and ST1A1, sphingolipid metabolism disorder, and attenuated inflammatory responses may contribute to the occurrence of neuro-PASC, whereas decreased levels of 7,8-dihydropterin and activation of steroid hormone biosynthesis may play a role in the repair process. Additionally, a biomarker cohort consisting of sphinganine, 7,8-dihydroneopterin, and ST1A1 was preliminarily demonstrated to have high value in diagnosing neuro-PASC. In summary, our study represents the first attempt to integrate the diagnostic benefits of CSF with the methodological advantages of multi-omics, thereby offering valuable insights into the pathogenesis of neuro-PASC and facilitating the work of neuroscientists in disclosing different neurological dimensions associated with COVID-19.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVES: Preliminary evidence suggests that the risk of Long COVID is higher among people with pre-existing medical conditions. Based on its proven adjuvant role in immunity, habitual sleep duration may alter the risk of developing Long COVID. The objective of this study was to determine whether the odds of Long COVID are higher among those with pre-existing medical conditions, and whether the strength of this association varies by habitual sleep duration. METHODS: Using data from 13,461 respondents from 16 countries who participated in the 2021 survey-based International COVID Sleep Study II (ICOSS II), we studied the associations between habitual sleep duration, pre-existing medical conditions, and Long COVID. RESULTS: Of 2,508 individuals who had COVID-19, 61% reported at least 1 Long COVID symptom. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of having Long COVID was 1.8-fold higher for average-length sleepers (6-9\u2009h/night) with pre-existing medical conditions compared with those without pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.84 [1.18-2.90]; P = .008). The risk of Long COVID was 3-fold higher for short sleepers with pre-existing medical conditions (aOR 2.95 [1.04-8.4]; P = .043) and not significantly higher for long sleepers with pre-existing conditions (aOR 2.11 [0.93-4.77]; P = .073) compared with average-length sleepers without pre-existing conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Habitual short nighttime sleep duration exacerbated the risk of Long COVID in individuals with pre-existing conditions. Restoring nighttime sleep to average duration represents a potentially modifiable behavioral factor to lower the odds of Long COVID for at-risk patients.

To understand psychological functioning in Long COVID further, this study examined personality responses on the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) to compare psychological functioning in a Long COVID group with a post-concussion syndrome (PCS) group, a syndrome with a significant psychological component. Participants and methods: Participants included 201 consecutive Long COVID outpatients (Mean age = 48.87\u2009years, mean education = 14.82, 71.6% Female, 82.6% White) and a comparison group of 102 consecutively referred PCS outpatients (Mean age = 46.08, mean education = 14.17, 63.7% Female, 88.2% White). Effect sizes and t-tests were calculated using the PAI validity, clinical, interpersonal, and treatment consideration scales as well as clinical subscales. Results: The results replicated earlier findings on the PAI in Long COVID by demonstrating that both Long COVID and PCS groups had the highest mean elevations on SOM and DEP scales but no statistically significant between group differences in mean scale elevations. Results support similarities in psychological functioning between Long COVID and PCS patients emphasizing the importance of evaluating psychological functioning in neuropsychological evaluations for these populations. Further, results suggest that psychological treatment strategies for PCS patients may be helpful for Long COVID patients, but more research is needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversy over treatment for people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a barrier to appropriate treatment. Energy management or pacing is a prominent coping strategy for people with ME/CFS. Whilst a definitive definition of pacing is not unanimous within the literature or healthcare providers, it typically comprises regulating activity to avoid post exertional malaise (PEM), the worsening of symptoms after an activity. Until now, characteristics of pacing, and the effects on patients' symptoms had not been systematically reviewed. This is problematic as the most common approach to pacing, pacing prescription, and the pooled efficacy of pacing was unknown. Collating evidence may help advise those suffering with similar symptoms, including long COVID, as practitioners would be better informed on methodological approaches to adopt, pacing implementation, and expected outcomes. OBJECTIVES: In this scoping review of the literature, we aggregated type of, and outcomes of, pacing in people with ME/CFS. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original investigations concerning pacing were considered in participants with ME/CFS. SOURCES OF EVIDENCE: Six electronic databases (PubMed, Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) were searched; and websites MEPedia, Action for ME, and ME Action were also searched for grey literature, to fully capture patient surveys not published in academic journals. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted. Review selection and characterisation was performed by two independent reviewers using pretested forms. RESULTS: Authors reviewed 177 titles and abstracts, resulting in 17 included studies: three randomised control trials (RCTs); one uncontrolled trial; one interventional case series; one retrospective observational study; two prospective observational studies; four cross-sectional observational studies; and five cross-sectional analytical studies. Studies included variable designs, durations, and outcome measures. In terms of pacing administration, studies used educational sessions and diaries for activity monitoring. Eleven studies reported benefits of pacing, four studies reported no effect, and two studies reported a detrimental effect in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable study designs and outcome measures, allied to poor to fair methodological quality resulted in heterogenous findings and highlights the requirement for more research examining pacing. Looking to the long COVID pandemic, our results suggest future studies should be RCTs utilising objectively quantified digitised pacing, over a longer duration of examination (i.e. longitudinal studies), using the core outcome set for patient reported outcome measures. Until these are completed, the literature base is insufficient to inform treatment practises for people with ME/CFS and long COVID.",

DESIGN: In this case-control observational pilot study, patients reporting lingering neurologic post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC, n\u00a0=\u00a010) symptoms at least 6 months after initial infection were compared to patients that recovered from COVID-19 without lingering symptoms (non-PASC, n\u00a0=\u00a013). We compared basic blood chemistry and select metabolites, lipids, hormones, inflammatory markers, and vitamins between groups. PASC and non-PASC subjects were tested for neurocognition and GH secretion, and given questionnaires to assess symptom severity. PASC subjects were also tested for glucose tolerance and adrenal function. RESULTS: PASC subjects reported significantly worse fatigue, sleep quality, depression, quality of life, and gastrointestinal discomfort compared to non-PASC. Although PASC subjects self-reported poor mental resilience, cognitive testing did not reveal significant differences between groups. Neurologic PASC symptoms were not linked to inflammatory markers or adrenal insufficiency, but were associated with reduced growth hormone secretion.

The scale response categories on C19-YRSm were done post hoc on data collected from the original version of C19-YRS. AIM: To evaluate the C19-YRSm scale using reliability and validity measures. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. METHODS: The study includes 369 patients (clinical group) and 426 subjects of the general population (control group) and captures their post-COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, the reliability of C19-YRSm was estimated by Cronbach's alpha coefficients of internal consistency and inter-item correlations for subscales ('Symptom severity, Functional disability, and Other symptoms'). Convergent validity was established using correlations between C19-YRSm and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The incremental validity of C19-YRSm was measured by introducing a hierarchical regression model using the C19-YRSm 'Overall health' subscale and FSS as criterion variables. RESULTS: C19-YRSm subscales have excellent internal consistencies (Cronbach's \u03b1 value 0.81-0.96) and acceptable inter-item correlations (r value 0.23-0.79). Hereafter, the convergent validity of the C19-YRSm is good due to significant correlations between C19-YRSm subscales and FSS and C19-YRSm subscales. Finally, the hierarchical regression analysis supported consistent evidence for the incremental validity of the C19-YRSm subscales.

METHODS: We used Office for National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey (CIS) data (February 2021-April 2022) of working-age participants (16-65 years). Exposures were industry, occupation and major Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) group. Outcomes were self-reported: (1) long-COVID symptoms and (2) reduced function due to long-COVID. Binary (outcome 1) and ordered (outcome 2) logistic regression were used to estimate odds ratios (OR)and prevalence (marginal means). RESULTS: Public facing industries, including teaching and education, social care, healthcare, civil service, retail and transport industries and occupations, had the highest likelihood of long-COVID. By major SOC group, those in caring, leisure and other services (OR 1.44, 95% CIs 1.38 to 1.52) had substantially elevated odds than average. For almost all exposures, the pattern of ORs for long-COVID symptoms followed SARS-CoV-2 infections, except for professional occupations (eg, some healthcare, education, scientific occupations) (infection: OR<1 ; long-COVID: OR>1). The probability of reporting long-COVID for industry ranged from 7.7% (financial services) to 11.6% (teaching and education); whereas the prevalence of reduced function by 'a lot' ranged from 17.1% (arts, entertainment and recreation) to 22%-23% (teaching and education and armed forces) and to 27% (not working). CONCLUSIONS: The risk and prevalence of long-COVID differs across industries and occupations.

Scalable characterization of PASC sub-phenotypes can enhance screening capacities, disease management, and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multi-centre observational cohort study, leveraging longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data of 30,422 patients from three healthcare systems in the Consortium for the Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE). From the total cohort, we applied a deductive approach on 12,424 individuals with follow-up data and developed a distributed representation learning process for providing augmented definitions for PASC sub-phenotypes. FINDINGS: Our framework characterized seven PASC sub-phenotypes. We estimated that on average 15.7% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients were likely to suffer from at least one PASC symptom and almost 5.98%, on average, had multiple symptoms. Joint pain and dyspnea had the highest prevalence, with an average prevalence of 5.45% and 4.53%, respectively.

A clear benefit of COVID-19 vaccination is a reduction mortality; however, COVID-19 vaccination may also prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aim to describe CV pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and describe how COVID-19 vaccination is a strategy for CVD prevention. RECENT FINDINGS: The risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination have been widely studied. Analysis of individuals with and without pre-existing CVD has shown that COVID-19 vaccination can prevent morbidity associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and reduce mortality. COVID-19 vaccination is effective in preventing myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, myopericarditis, and long COVID, all associated with CVD risk factors. Vaccination reduces mortality in patients with pre-existing CVD. Further study investigating ideal vaccination schedules for individuals with CVD should be undertaken to protect this vulnerable group and address new risks from variants of concern.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide, and while the mortality rate remains the primary concern, it is becoming increasingly apparent that many COVID-19 survivors experience long-term sequelae, representing a major concern for both themselves and healthcare providers. Comparing long-term sequelae following COVID-19 to those of other respiratory viruses such as influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 is an essential step toward understanding the extent and impact of these sequelae. A literature search was carried out using the PubMed. database. Search-terms included \"persistent\", \"long-term\", \"chronic\", and MeSH-terms for SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and Influenza. Only English-language articles were selected. Articles were screened by title/abstract and full-text readings. Key points for comparison were persistent symptoms\u00a0>\u00a04\u00a0weeks, virus type, study design, population size, admission status, methods, and findings. Thirty-one articles were included: 19 on SARS-CoV-1, 10 on influenza, and 2 on MERS-CoV-survivors. Damage to the respiratory system was the main long-term manifestation after the acute phase of infection. Quality of life-related and psychological sequelae were the second and third most widely reported symptoms, respectively. Consistent with long-term sequelae from COVID-19, persisting cardiovascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal impairments were also reported. In summary, the long-term sequelae following COVID-19 are a significant concern, and while long-term sequelae following influenza, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-1 have also been reported, their prevalence and severity are less clear. It is essential to continue to study and monitor the long-term effects of all respiratory viruses so as to improve our understanding and develop strategies for prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Headache is one of the most frequent symptoms of the acute and post-acute phase of COVID-19. Specific epidemiology, clinical features, risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment have been reported in these two scenarios. With this narrative review of the literature, we aim to provide updated knowledge on headache in the COVID-19 setting and give clinicians a practical approach on this topic to guide them in their clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Headache mechanisms in COVID-19 are still poorly understood. Strong evidence is also lacking on how to best treat and manage these patients, especially those with persistent and disabling headache after COVID-19. Data are also scarce on the characteristics of headache in COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron) variants and how these may influence the acute and persistent symptoms of COVID-19. Patients with pre-existing primary headache disorders remain a particularly concerning population due to their biological predisposition in suffering from headaches and the potential risk of worsening in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although there is an exponential growth of scientific evidence, studies are often controversial and focused on the first wave of the pandemic, making COVID-19 headache still a challenging matter for clinicians. New research is therefore needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), colloquially known as long COVID, is a multisystem condition characterized by persistent symptoms beyond 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. More than 60 million people with PCC worldwide need prompt assessment, diagnosis, and monitoring, with many requiring specialist help from a multidisciplinary team of health care professionals (HCPs). Consequently, a scalable digital system is required for both people with PCC and HCPs to capture the breadth of symptoms and their impact on health, using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and patient-reported experience measures (PREMs). OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop and implement a novel PCC digital PROM (DPROM) platform for (1) securely collecting PROM and PREM data from people with PCC, (2) enabling users to monitor symptoms longitudinally and assess response to treatment, (3) generating reports for the electronic health records (EHRs), (4) providing summary reports on PCC services based on national requirements, and (5) facilitating the sharing of relevant data with authorized research teams to accelerate our understanding of this new condition and evaluate new strategies to manage PCC. METHODS: We (1) undertook requirement analysis with people with PCC, HCPs, and researchers to identify the needs of the DPROM platform and determine its required functionalities; (2) designed and developed a clinically useful web portal for staff and a mobile app for patients, with a web-based alternative app to improve patient and staff choice, limit the risk of digital exclusion, and account for variability across services; (3) determined the PROMs and PREMs that PCC services would prefer to use on the platform; and (4) designed the summary report function that can be generated for each user for the EHR and for reporting to national health authorities. RESULTS: A DPROM platform to record PCC symptom profile, condition severity, functional disability, and quality of life, based on the C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale) and other PROMs and PREMs, was developed. Individual-level medical information and details on the COVID-19 illness can be captured systematically. The platform generates easy-to-understand scores, radar plots and line graphs for people with PCC to self-monitor their condition and for HCPs to assess the natural course of the condition and the response to interventions. Clinics can configure a suite of PROMs and PREMs based on their local and national service and commissioning requirements and support research studies which require large-scale data collection on PROMs. The DPROM platform enables automatic aggregate data analysis for services to undertake service evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. The DPROM platform generated summary report can be uploaded to the EHRs of people with PCC. CONCLUSIONS: A multifunctional DPROM platform to assess, grade, and monitor PCC has been developed. Future research will analyze the system's usability in specialist PCC clinical services and other long-term conditions.",

It details the relationship between these indices and PCC, describing study subjects, testing methods (web portal and mobile app), and results. The rationale for the test is the need for a scalable digital system to assess, diagnose, and monitor people with PCC, as well as to support research studies requiring large-scale data collection on PROMs."

Diagnosis of ME/CFS remains challenging, with most patients relying on self-report, questionnaires, and subjective measures to receive a diagnosis, and many never receiving a clear diagnosis at all. In this study, a single-cell Raman platform and artificial intelligence are utilized to analyze blood cells from 98 human subjects, including 61 ME/CFS patients of varying disease severity and 37 healthy and disease controls. These results demonstrate that Raman profiles of blood cells can distinguish between healthy individuals, disease controls, and ME/CFS patients with high accuracy (91%), and can further differentiate between mild, moderate, and severe ME/CFS patients (84%). Additionally, specific Raman peaks that correlate with ME/CFS phenotypes and have the potential to provide insights into biological changes and support the development of new therapeutics are identified. This study presents a promising approach for aiding in the diagnosis and management of ME/CFS and can be extended to other unexplained chronic diseases such as long COVID and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, which share many of the same symptoms as ME/CFS.",

        "abstract": "This study examines whether activation of the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway is associated with anxiety symptoms due to Long COVID. We selected 90 participants, 60 Long COVID patients and 30 individuals without any symptoms following acute COVID-19 infection. Using cluster analysis and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) score, the pure HAMA anxiety score, serum tryptophan (TRP) and kynurenine (KYN), the KYN/TRP ratio (all measured during Long COVID), and oxygen saturation (SpO2) (measured during the acute phase of COVID-19), we were able to classify Long COVID patients into two distinct clusters with an adequate silhouette cohesion and separation index (0.58): cluster 1 (n\u00a0=\u00a061) and cluster 2 (n\u00a0=\u00a029). Cluster 2 patients had lower SpO2 and TRP levels, as well as higher KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, and HAMA scores than cluster 1. Regression analysis revealed that the KYN/TRP ratio explained 14.4\u00a0% of the variance in the HAMA score (F\u00a0=\u00a014.81, df\u00a0=\u00a01/88, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In addition, regression analysis revealed that SpO2 partially explained the variance in serum TRP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.396, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), KYN/TRP ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.248, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), and the HAMA score (r\u00a0=\u00a0-\u00a00.279, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). The current data imply that decreased SpO2 during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection is predictive of anxiety caused by Long COVID. Our data reveal that around 32\u00a0% of Long COVID patients have elevated IDO activity in association with elevated anxiety.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long COVID or post-COVID condition (PCC) is a common complication following acute COVID-19 infection. PCC is a multi-systems disease with neurocognitive impairment frequently reported regardless of age. Little is known about the risk factors, associated biomarkers and clinical trajectory of patients with this symptom. OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in clinical risk factors, associated biochemical markers and longitudinal clinical trajectories between patients with PCC with subjective neurocognitive symptoms (NC+) or without (NC-). METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal cohort study was performed using a well-characterized provincial database of patients with clinically confirmed PCC separated into NC+\u2009and NC- cohorts. Demographical, clinical and biochemical differences at initial consultation between the two patient cohorts were analyzed in cross-section. Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors for neurocognitive impairment. Determination of the recovery trajectory was performed using serial assessments of the patient-reported health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) metric Eq-5D-5L-vas score. FINDINGS: Women, milder acute infection and pre-existing mental health diagnoses were independently associated with subjective neurocognitive impairment at 8\u00a0months post-infection. NC\u2009+\u2009patients demonstrated lower levels of IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 compared to NC- patients. The NC\u2009+\u2009cohort had poorer HR-QoL at initial consultation 8\u00a0months post-infection with gradual improvement over 20\u00a0months post-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairment represents a severe phenotype of PCC, associated with unique risk factors, aberrancy in immune response and a delayed recovery trajectory. Those with risk factors for neurocognitive impairment can be identified early in the disease trajectory for more intense medical follow-up.",

These include anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and insomnia. The longitudinal evolution of this neuropsychiatric burden is poorly understood and clinical guidelines concerning treatment are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the longitudinal evolution of neuropsychiatric symptoms in the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) syndrome and examine symptom treatment at a single center. METHODS: Consecutive participants experiencing persistent neurologic symptoms after acute COVID-19 infection were recruited from October 2020 to July 2022. Data collected included COVID-19 infection history, neurological exam and review of systems, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and self-reported surveys concerning neuropsychiatric symptoms and treatment. Data were collected at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 106 participants (mean age 48.6, females 67%) were included in the study. At 1-year follow-up, 72.5% of participants reported at least one neuropsychiatric symptom. Over half (52.5%) of participants reported persistent fatigue. At baseline, 38.8% of all participants had met the established MoCA cut-off score of\u2009<\u200926 for mild cognitive impairment; this decreased to 20.0% at 1\u00a0year. COVID-19 infection severity was associated with neuro-PASC symptoms (including fatigue and anxiety) at 1\u00a0year. Overall, 29% of participants started at least one new medication for COVID-19-associated neuropsychiatric symptoms. Of the participants who started new medications, fatigue was the most common indication (44.8%) followed by insomnia (27.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric symptoms related to neuro-PASC improve over time but can persist for over a year post-recovery. Most treatment modalities targeted neuro-PASC fatigue.",
